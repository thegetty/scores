  blurb: "Mieko Shiomi’s multipart mail art project *Spatial Poem* harnessed the artist’s global network to test the interpretive possibilities of nine individual text scores written by the artist and shared worldwide. Launched in 1965 and concluding ten years later, *Spatial Poem* captured the broad utility, international reach, distributed authorship, and generative potential of the era’s new notational forms. It provides a compelling bookend to over two decades’ worth of innovative artistic experimentations with scores featured in *The Scores Project*."
