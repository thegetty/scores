Octaves up or down are marked with local brackets and an “8” or “16.” Clusters are special attacks that include all chromatic pitches in a certain range—to be played with the palm or groups of fingers—and are notated with a vertical line linking the highest and lowest pitches of the cluster. The clusters are fully chromatic (including all notes within the boundaries) unless marked by either a natural sign, in which case only the white notes of the keyboard are to be played, or with a sharp sign, in which case only the black notes are to be played."

On the one hand, there is a sense of scandal over the musical avant-garde, as shown through remarks about audiences dwindling away, protesting, or ignoring the music. On the other hand, there is an unflinching admiration for Tudor’s technical expertise and credibility as a pianist. This proved to be a powerful combination for these composers; an audience member could complain they did not like the experiment, but Tudor’s expertise thwarted accusations of outright fraudulence."

At least one heckler audibly wished for the actual destruction of a piano, an action that would anticipate the destructive play of Fluxus affiliate Philip Corner’s *Piano Activities* (1962). In an echo of 4′33″ (1952), the reviewer also notes the abundant use of silence in the compositions Tudor performed, remarking that during these extended periods “one can almost hear the air molecules rushing past one’s ear.”"

These realizations on cardstock could be reshuffled and bound in various orders."

Cage credited composer Henry Cowell for inspiring his work with extended techniques."

    extended_caption: "This is David Tudor’s copy of John Cage’s *Solo for Piano*, copied out in Cage’s trademark penmanship, which features capital letters with exaggerated serifs. Marveling at the score can be an overwhelming experience; the notation asks us to puzzle over an exceedingly complicated set of rules and procedures. Following the title page, Cage’s score includes two introductory pages of lettered directions that serve as a key for deciphering the lettered graphs that follow. Each graph, paired with its corresponding instructions, thus functions as its own self-contained mini score. Globally, there is a playful sense of inventiveness and creativity to the visual language of Cage’s graphs. In fact, spurred by the encouragement of Jasper Johns and Robert Rauschenberg, the score for *Concert for Piano and Orchestra* was exhibited at a midtown gallery in New York just prior to the Town Hall premiere, and it was thus Cage’s first score to be [publicly appreciated as visual art](/object-index/095/). Though many of the *Concert*’s graphs are quite indeterminate, leaving many of the compositional process up to the performer, Tudor’s performances turned out a certain consistent impression; reviewers attested that the *Solo for Piano* sounded “mixed-up,” and that it evoked “anarchy,” a sense of psychosis, or even a “jungle.”"

    extended_caption: "The thirteen orchestral parts for the *Concert* are essentially solo instrument parts with single attacks and a wide range of extended techniques. Many of them were created in conversation with individual performers who introduced John Cage to various nontraditional possibilities of each instrument. The performances of these parts displeased Cage. As the recordings featured here attest, these performers often played loudly and frequently competed with David Tudor. Some players strayed from the score with what Cage later described as “unprofessional” and “foolish” playing. Some responsibility for the difficulties seemed to lie with Cage; indeed, he was unaccustomed to writing for an orchestra, and the piece’s lack of traditional orchestration was inevitably going to lead to the different sounds stepping on one another’s toes. We might speculate: Did Cage realize he needed a stronger (dare we say “intentional” or “expressive”) hand in sculpting the result? Whatever the case, the difficulties exemplify a recurring problem Cage had when he was not working with trusted collaborators like Tudor. For his book *Experimentalism Otherwise* (2011) Benjamin Piekut interviewed the original performers from the New York Philharmonic who participated in the slightly later, and even more controversial, premiere of *Atlas Eclipticalis* (1964) under the direction of Leonard Bernstein."

This two-ring binder would have allowed Tudor to reshuffle his realizations of individual graphs from *Solo for Piano* into different sequences for performances of varying lengths. In paging through the realization pages in the binder, readers will notice several characteristics of Tudor’s notation. The basics (the notes, clefs, etc.) are written in black pen, while Tudor used blue pen for bar lines, dynamics, pedaling, and short phrases of language that describe specialized techniques. Note that, in blue, Tudor often adopts a uniquely precise numerical notation, borrowed from composer Bo Nilsson, for dynamics (0.5 being the quietest, up to 10.5 being the loudest). Tudor’s red pen marks off unusual sounds, groups attacks in a way that corresponds to a given specialized technique (as in “bounce 3-fingers, left hand” in his realization of graph J), and diagrams parts of his realization in a way that mirrors visual elements of Cage’s graphs. In pencil, one finds labels corresponding to Tudor’s sequencing, which includes the Cage graph, the page in Cage’s score, and the duration or timing of Tudor’s page, along with miscellaneous annotations. See the [Playback section for chapter 2](/02/#playback) for visible explanations of Tudor’s various conventions."

Among these realization sheets, note that in Tudor’s realization of graph BT one finds short phrases of language indicating specialized auxiliary sounds, the eschewal of use of the staff to mark the passage of time, and the adoption of numbered list for which Western musical techniques and skills are no longer necessary. Tudor’s realization of graph BT echoes his use of “readymade” sound-producing materials in earlier works like [*Water Music*](/object-index/129/) (1952) and anticipates the use of language popularized by La Monte Young, George Brecht, George Maciunas, Yoko Ono, and Jackson Mac Low in the coming years."

    extended_caption: "This is a reproduction of David Tudor’s second realization of the *Solo for Piano*, used in the 1959 *Indeterminacy* recording. John Cage, who had already made a practice of giving lectures that helped make his work accessible to audiences, recalled, in September 1958, that Tudor had suggested that Cage give a lecture consisting entirely of stories. Cage delivered the first version—thirty stories—at the Brussels Fair that month, with no musical accompaniment. In March of 1959, Cage was then asked to deliver a ninety-minute lecture at Columbia University’s Teachers College. For the event, Cage added sixty stories and asked Tudor to provide a ninety-minute accompaniment. For the occasion, Tudor prepared a second, far sparser realization of the *Solo for Piano*. He culled all the sheets from his first realization that consisted of “single ictus” attacks (fifty-three out of his existing sixty-three) and “superimposed” them. By superimposing, Tudor means this: Imagine putting these sheets into a single stack, converting the papers into transparencies, and then enlarging a single image of all attacks into a ninety-minute landscape. Tudor achieved this by measuring the horizontal distances of individual attacks within each graph. Then, by way of meticulous calculations, he expanded these distances into a single ninety-minute backdrop in which the attacks of each graph are interwoven with every other. In the resultant performance score, each horizontal line is roughly thirty seconds, with a page equaling roughly one minute, and individual events are notated proportionally. Readers interested in the nuts and bolts of Tudor’s calculations will find a complete digitization of Tudor’s materials for the second realization in the [Archive section for chapter 2](/02/#archive)."

    extended_caption: "In his premiere performance of the first realization, David Tudor chose to play graph J early on—thirty seconds in. It is a ferociously violent and dissonant series of flourishes that use the whole range of the piano, a prime example of Tudor’s pianism at its most spectacular. Note that Tudor’s trademark deadpan stage presence (he reported to his partner, M. C. Richards, that he was known as the “Buster Keaton of the piano” in Europe) often conveyed to audiences a solemn and self-negating commitment to high modernism. But here, at Town Hall, in front of the largest audience of his career—the *New York Times* reported nearly one thousand people in attendance—and in a performance that was Tudor’s first performance of a piano concerto, Tudor gives himself a bombastic solo entrance in the venerable tradition of piano concertos from Beethoven through Rachmaninoff. Note that Tudor, here as elsewhere, simplifies John Cage’s instructions. He ignores Cage’s logically convoluted instructions about “direction in space time” and simply obeys the number of notes (with a little fudging) and the outer pitch parameters (quite strictly), deciding to play a series of ascending or descending gamuts within these parameters. Little in Cage’s graph prescribes tone clusters, let alone bombastic ones. It is Tudor’s choice to play the entire graph in just over thirty seconds. Another perfectly compliant realization of graph J could entail delicate scales—interrupted or done only in fragments—sweeping the range of the piano over the course of two or three minutes. Note as well that in the sketches for graph J, Tudor at first has a different order; the sequencing here is Tudor’s compositional choice."

    extended_caption: "After the explosion of graph J, David Tudor inserts a silence of about fifteen seconds and then plays the eight chords of graph K around 1′20″. Graph K is visually distinctive; it is noted for having adorned the cover of C.F. Peters’s John Cage catalog. It is a grand staff, thick lined and gargantuan in its proportions, with a framework of dual ledger lines extending on either side. The clefs float off to the left, adrift from their usual positions. Instead of notes, Cage has drawn a jumble of polygons with vertices labeled as specific pitches. And the instructions for graph K are perplexing, to say the least. What does it mean to play only an odd or even number of tones in a performance? We surely know what the sided figures are, and Tudor plays them in the manner of staccato grace-like notes or punctuated attacks. But in relation to what? It may be that the logical cul-de-sac of Cage’s instructions is part of the point; the existence of a correct solution may be immaterial. Perhaps Cage is foregrounding inexhaustible esotericism—his almost mystical and naturalistic attachment to the impersonal powers of procedures, instructions, and calculations. This formalism provides discipline for all that is noble in the practice of indeterminacy. Note as well in Tudor’s performance that he uses the notation here, as elsewhere, as a guide for sequencing the tasks. Other than playing graph K relatively quickly, Tudor makes no effort to read the spacing of the chords as proportional notation (in which a timeline for a performance would move steadily from left to right)."

    extended_caption: "Graph T is one of the most virtuosic of David Tudor’s graph-realizations in the first realization. Again, John Cage’s choice of words in his instructions is strange. It is not clear what an “influence” is. What is clear is that the amoebas “grab” pitch material and temporal duration that should be played as a moving cluster. As with the others, Tudor translates the amoebas into traditional notation, with sharp lines indicating swipes of the palm or finger to fill out the contours of the cluster. Cage’s system of numbered dynamics (1–64) Tudor translates to his standard conventional scale of 0.5–10.5 (in blue ink). At the premiere, as with many of the excerpts, the sonic result is something like a pianistic version of psychosis. Again, as with graph J, Tudor could have fully complied with Cage’s graph by excerpting just a few clusters and playing them at a slow speed. By playing it fast, and in its entirety, he foregrounds his own Artaudian voice—a spectacle of an abstracted, formalized, and impersonal violence. In the Town Hall performance, Tudor executes graph T between 4′20″ and 4′55″."

    extended_caption: "This graph is directly redolent of the notational techniques used in Morton Feldman’s graph compositions, almost to the point of appearing as a quotation. John Cage makes the debt to Feldman explicit when he begins his instructions with “Graph Music” and identifies the time unit. Here, though, a complicated wrinkle presents itself, one that, we hope, the animation makes clear. Numbers of notes can be played in any portion of the given box, and, as Cage states, the clefs are largely “mobile” (with the bottom regions as necessarily in the treble region). David Tudor elects to play the whole graph at the top of the piano and writes a charmingly self-contained music box of steady quarter and eighth-note attacks with a few triplet figures inserted. The sketches for graph AY show clear parallelisms to [Tudor’s 1953 realization of Feldman’s *Intersection 3*](/object-index/014/)."

    extended_caption: "Graph CE looks a bit like experimental-notation wallpaper or an aleatoric midcentury countertop. Again, clefs are ambiguous. The graph is filled with ledger lines. Uniquely, in this graph John Cage’s four staves are crooked and intersecting such that any given note has one, two, or three different possible “readings.” Cage’s instructions remain minimal, however (“make intervals and aggregates where suggested by notation”), and David Tudor’s reading is correspondingly straightforward. He reads the graph left to right horizontally, and simply assigns one, two, or three pitch values to each note. For note heads with two or three pitches, Tudor uses these pitches as the endpoints of a large cluster, rendered in his realization as two close-together parallel lines, many of which require an entire forearm to play. Dynamic values are reduced to three traditional markings in blue (p, m, f). Aside from a few blasts from the trumpeter Melvyn Broiles, strings dominate the orchestral texture during this moment of this performance, providing Tudor’s solo with plenty of acoustic space."

    extended_caption: "In this flipbook, users can press play to hear the entire recording of the Town Hall premiere. On the lower half of the screen is the sheet from the first realization that David Tudor would have had on the piano’s music tray. On the top half of the screen, users will find a reconstruction of the graph(s) that Tudor realized. Perhaps surprisingly, Tudor’s performance sequence for the premiere has a certain classical sense of balance. He alternates between dramatic performances of individual graphs and stoic silences; only in a few places are multiple graphs superimposed. John Cage may have complained about the “foolish” behavior of some of the musicians—but, in 1958, a specialist performer in experimental music was an uncommon occurrence. All three brass players Cage hired (trombonist Frank Rehak; tuba player Don Butterfield, the improviser of Stravinsky’s *Rite of Spring* around 3′25″; and trumpeter Melvyn Broiles, who plays a jazz riff around 6′40″ were schooled in jazz; in fact, Butterfield and Rehak were essentially jazz musicians. (Broiles did limited jazz and session work but had considerable experience as a classical trumpeter.) Also note the sounds of the audience: raucous and wild, Town Hall was reportedly filled with insiders, friends, and onlookers that night, even at the late hour of 11 p.m., when the *Concert* was finally performed. They cheer a number of Tudor's auxillary sounds and more unusual feats (16′20″, 16′40″, 17′12″, 22′10″, 23′15″): the tape playback, the noises made on the strings of the inside of the piano, and the slinky that featured a contact microphone. Were these signs of disrespect? Or could they be understood as part of Cage’s spectacle? If the subsequent performances with Merce Cunningham’s *Antic Meet* (1958) are a meaningful comparison, the laughter may have been, in some ways, part of the act. Cunningham’s choreography for *Antic Meet* was a vaudevillian audience favorite."

Pauline Oliveros organized the concerts at Mills College in honor of Tudor and played horn and tuba. Morton Subotnick, a cofounder with Oliveros of the San Francisco Tape Music Center, played the clarinet part. Tudor performs many of his virtuosic graph realizations, and in a context in which the accompanying instruments give him plenty of space to be heard. In a way that would challenge all who might claim Tudor did not improvise, comparison between this performance and the Town Hall premiere illustrates how flexible Tudor’s performances of his own realizations can be; the timing and rhythm of any performance of the same realization sheet can vary quite significantly."

Though he seems not to have attended the concert, the writer’s observations about Tudor’s work (presumably based on the *Harper’s* article) exemplify the tendency of middlebrow critics to engage in their own armchair philosophizing about the upending of traditional ontologies of music. The author calls Tudor’s performance an indeterminate “thing,” and compares experimental notation to a tradition of formalized diagraming that is more familiar but equally complex—a football playbook."

As was common in German music criticism, the reviewer labels Cage as “American,” recognizes his existing notoriety, and associates him with chance procedures, games, and unusual extended techniques and preparations. Though unlike a 1956 reviewer who categorized his work as a “sound experiment,” here, the reviewer marginalizes him an “enfant terrible” of the German tradition of *Neue Musik* (New Music). Though the reviewer misidentifies Karlheinz Stockhausen’s *Klavierstück XI* as *Klavierstück IX*, they correctly describe the indeterminate elements of Stockhausen’s score: wherever Tudor’s eye falls on the page of this oversize score, he is to play the notation he finds."

As a result, Cage’s scores began to be accorded recognition as visual works of art. Note the strong contrast there is between Ashton’s description of the visual impact of his score (“calligraphic beauty” and “a delicate sense of design”) as opposed to the often violent and jarring impact that Cage’s “mixed-up” sound world had on audiences. Like the disjuncture between the impersonal grace of Zen and the crushing violence of Artaud’s Theater of Cruelty, the sensory impact of Cage’s chance-based work confronts viewers and listeners with strange and puzzling contradictions. What Cage’s work ultimately is remains deliberately elusive."

Throughout the later 1950s and the 1960s, the duo would continue to refine and rework the showmanship of their performances."

Kastendieck suggests that Cage is highly indebted to non-Western music and describes his 1930s and ’40s works as struggling to keep up with various versions of the real thing (jazz drumming, Balinense gamelan, Kabuki theater). He refers, quite critically, to *Concert for Piano and Orchestra* as “sheer anarchy” and an “evolutionary cul-de-sac.” Ironically, the phrases might have pleased Cage, notwithstanding the reviewer’s critical intentions. Cage’s *Imaginary Landscape No. 1* (1939) is compared to two other pressing cultural phenomena of the 1950s: horror films and air-raid sirens."

In line with other reviews, Parmenter summarizes John Cage’s program note, playing the role of Cage’s public pedagogue. Whereas some high modernists like Milton Babbitt defended their avant-garde practice as a bourgeoning research discipline among institutional circles of specialists, Cage paralleled Allan Kaprow’s emergent practice of centering pedagogical gestures: he repeatedly sought to explain the structure and significance of his work to his audiences. And to do so he used a variety of media—lectures, publications, press releases, program notes, television appearances, and, in this case, newspaper reviews."

Writing just seven months following the launch of Sputnik, he says that Cage’s music, in all its desires to channel natural forces rather than human intentions, was akin to a cosmic form of alien communication “based in a revised Morse Code.” Instead of discussing the principles of indeterminacy found in Cage’s program notes, Biancolli focuses on the visual spectacle of an unconventional stage filled with midcentury high technology, and, with reference to Cage’s earlier works of the 1930s and ’40s, he emphasizes the materiality of the percussion (“pure metal, wood and drum skin”). He empathetically describes Cage’s “foolish” performers as simply untrained for experimental music and devotes the final third of his review to questions of ontology (“Is it music?”). Ironically, it is the seriousness of Cage’s intentions that, for Biancolli, make his non-intentional music worth attending to. It is an avant-garde echo of Immanuel Kant’s Enlightenment formula for the work of art: “purposiveness without purpose.”"

Her conclusion: Nothing in particular—their collaborative work is there merely to uncannily remind us of who and what we already are. Another echoed theme is the presence of laughter during the performance, which, in this case, is clearly amplified by Cunningham’s vaudevillian choreography for *Antic Meet*, in which he dances with a chair attached to his back. The dance unfolds amid the *Solo for Piano*’s “jungle” of sounds, which here, coupled with Cunningham’s polished choreography, turned out to be “a hit” with the audience. In a kind of visual pedagogy, Lloyd reproduces graph A from Cage’s *Solo for Piano* without explanation."

That is, far from accepting sounds as formalist exercises in chance and indeterminacy, many critics could not resist the temptation to hear them as representations of violence (as clashes, collisions, fights, and struggles). Though Cage did not endorse these types of interpretations, his interest in Antonin Artaud during the 1950s that he shared with Morton Feldman, David Tudor, and M. C. Richards suggests that such associations may not have been far from his mind. The reviewer also represents the performer’s choices as “improvisation,” a word Cage distanced himself from during these years. He considered the term to have unpalatable associations with ego-driven choices even as he turned to improvisational performances during the 1960s."

    extended_caption: "Herbert Schultz’s review of John Cage’s *Concert for Piano and Orchestra* features an involved description of the boisterous and humorous sounds produced by David Tudor on piano and the small orchestra accompanying him. Schultz also acknowledges that Cage’s experimentalism has displaced the authority of tones as the building blocks of music as they were traditionally defined. But instead of crediting his chance procedures as a profound meditation on nature, Zen, or impersonality, he bemusedly casts them as theatrical—a *grotesken Kabarett-Ulk* (grotesque cabaret-joke)."

The reviewer’s overall impression is negative, claiming that the experimentation is arbitrary, capricious, and unserious. The reviewer also casts doubt on Cage’s credentials as a former student of composer Arnold Schoenberg and on his knowledge of Asian philosophy. They add, with a nationalist chauvinism that was typical of the period, that the festival will not suffer reputational damage from Cage’s performance. Though the performers of the orchestral parts were German, the reviewer notes that they left the stage during the raucous applause in a way that they may have imagined approximated an “American hillbilly village band” (*amerikanische Hillbilly-Dorfkapelle*)."

Driesch claims that Cage’s *Concert* is better understood as instructions for “slapstick” (*Klamauk*) rather than as musical notes that result in music. He also goes into more detail about the cheering audience, suggesting that they are being polite, all too aware of not wanting to be embarrassed by acting scandalized in front of avant-garde music. Driesch then intriguingly notes that the audience that approved of Cage’s spectacle had scruffy hairstyles and appearances that defied gender norms."

Like other commentators of Cage’s work in Germany, Hans Heinz Stuckenschmidt is dismissive of chance procedures and Asian philosophy, and regards the extended techniques as more “cabaret” than music. A musicologist, Stuckenschmidt correctly frames Cage as indebted to the Dada movement of 1916. Though he is not as categorically dismissive of the work as some of his central European colleagues, he does use Cage to pose ontological questions about the work: “What is this?”"

The author credits Tudor with being not only an excellent performer but also someone with exemplary skills in being able to “read” and “comprehend” these works. That is, the question of basic musical literacy is at stake. Can this material be read? Tudor’s reputation is that of a person who has both the physical ability and the intellectual capacity for decoding customized, esoteric, and future-oriented musical systems. The author ends the review with a remarkably philosophical explanation of the music, one that weaves together nihilism, futurism, and necessity: “The philosophic implications of works like these may be disturbingly nihilist. So be it. Whatever their motivation, the pieces are giving us new and usable procedures to add to our musical vocabulary. This, if nothing else, makes them valid.”"

In 1959, Cage began to teach a course in mushroom identification at the New School for Social Research alongside his famed course in experimental composition that had attracted many aspiring avant-garde artists who were not necessarily musicians."

This review is distinct in that it shows that by 1959, David Tudor’s realization had become far sparser and employed provocatively long silences (a sparseness that was much less present in the Town Hall premiere of 1958)."

Grunfeld also remarks how significant the crowd sounds (cheers and laughter) are in the recording. When discussing the sounds as opposed to the theories, he, like many reviewers, favors Cage’s earlier work, referring to *Williams Mix* (1951–53) as “a skittish and superficial affair” by comparison with the Orientalizing primitivism of the prepared piano and percussion works."

Dance is dance; music is music. Thus, for a dance critic, the scant and dismissive coverage Walter Terry gives to John Cage is symptomatic. He describes the avant-garde sounds as “strange scores,” and after a brilliantly sensitive account of Merce Cunningham’s choreography, he remarks on their indigestibility by claiming to find himself craving “thirty-two bars of [Ludwig] Minkus” by the end of the concert. (Minkus was a nineteenth-century composer of traditional ballet music.) Despite this, the high-modernist rhetoric of the dance is hardly lost on him. Terry describes Cunningham’s solo dance *Changeling* (1957) as a chilling but still human picture of negation—“a portrait of an unwanted, or uncertain, creature.”"

He compares Tudor’s composers to children who ignorantly destroy the highly valued tradition of Western Art Music. Echoing contemporaneous critiques of high formalism leveled by Theodor Adorno, Stanley Cavell, and many others at midcentury, Lang also critiques the excessively scientific approaches to musical composition as insensitive to the texture of “human frailty.” In Lang’s view, the avant-garde, driven by an excessive love for machines and science, has become in its own way metaphysical, cleaving to an apocalyptic vision of life. His critique exhibits the reflexes of midcentury positivism (“the facts contradict it”) and nostalgic conceptions of genius, originality, and universal historical progress based in a “heartbeat of culture.” Elliott Carter, a comparatively traditional high modernist who left considerable place for human gesture in his work, serves as the more accessible foil for the nihilistic indulgences of Tudor’s experimentalism."

From a traditionalist perspective, due to the extreme discontinuity of the recital’s chance-derived works, he worries about boredom (notwithstanding what he describes as an “amused and amazed” audience). But in response to the electronic sounds that Tudor used in that performance of John Cage’s *Solo for Piano* (likely the second realization), Sherman remarks the inverse: like a wrestling match on television, or a sports game that entails violence, he hears the electronic aspects of Cage’s music as a “fearful bombardment” that is, no doubt due to its abstraction, still potentially “great fun.”"

The rhetoric of war and violence reminiscent of Antonin Artaud’s aesthetics appears as well. For Guzzo, the concert is as much a theatrical demonstration as it is a musical performance."

Bernstein gave a didactic introductory lecture to the conservative New York Philharmonic audience beforehand that explained the philosophy and notation behind chance operations, insisting that the works are serious and should be taken seriously because of the rigor of their compositional procedures. The reviewer documents the fiasco that took place at the performance itself. This was a period when Cage and David Tudor made considerable use of amplification, and Cage’s score stipulates that contact microphones be attached to the instruments of the orchestra. The result was louder and more jarring than the music the philharmonic audience was accustomed to. Many walked out during the performance and many who stayed booed and jeered upon the performance’s conclusion."

The written musical notation realizes a scale that goes from the traditionally known notation up to the musically still unknown sign: the drawing. In one case (*No. 4*), an independent drawing by the author, from ten years earlier, was adopted for the hands of the pianist. Often the sound act that such drawings can generate remains in the hands of the pianist. The five pieces, removed from a larger cycle, come together, detaching themselves from it, in a minor cycle virtually disposed in the global cycle. Thus, a complete part (*No. 2*) will become unfinished, and another complete part becomes partial (*No. 5*).”"

After all, in providing a score that is more of a drawing and provides little of any guidance to the performer, Bussotti effectively prompted Tudor to take a greater creative role in deciding what to play. This animation provides what we consider to be a reasonably accurate estimate as to how Tudor went about realizing the score for *No. 3*. On the left is Bussotti’s score, on the right is Tudor’s realization. We are fairly certain Tudor tried to play each element of Bussotti’s drawing, and loosely travelled from the left / top of the page to the bottom right, though with plenty of bouncing around the page in between. In many instances, Tudor’s penciled realization visually resembles various “events” or “objects” in Bussotti’s score (some of which Tudor circled in his own copy of Bussotti’s score). The wide variety of extended techniques Tudor used are largely a product of his own imagination as a performer; nothing in Bussotti’s score specifies that various kinds of sounds be made."

Tudor takes precise measurements between more than one hundred “blobs and dots” in the scribble of the score, from five rising and falling lines that originate in staff 3. Each of these five lines corresponds to one of five parameters for a musical attack: sequence measured, frequency, timbre, duration, and intensity. Two further parameters—range and density—are based not in precise calculations, but in rough distributions of the events visually on the page. In this folder one can also find keys to Tudor’s customized notation for his realization (related to clef, register, volume, etc.)."

The reviewer notes that *No. 3* of Bussotti’s *Pieces* takes Cage’s principle of indeterminacy to a new limit that spills over into the realm of visual art. Far from the scandalized conservatism of many of the reviewers of Cage and Tudor’s Cologne concert the previous year, this reviewer is generally sympathetic to the project of score-based experimentation and adds that the Italian audience seemed engaged."

The review, which is largely informative, notes that organizing three concerts in Italy (the other two were in Padua and Rome) was a considerable challenge. It describes Bussotti and Evangelisti as holding “extremely advanced positions” (*posizioni estremamente avanzate*), adding that Bussotti had extended Cage’s use of indeterminacy into the realm of graphic notation in *No. 3* of *Pieces* in what reviewer Lodovico Mamprin describes as a “a desperate search for order” (*una disperata ricerca di ordine*)."

Schonberg remarks that adjectives used to describe Tudor include “enigmatic,” “mystical,” “shy,” and “permanently concentrated.” Elsewhere he claims Tudor and his circle are surrounded by Zen Buddhism, mysticism, and mathematics. As with [Ed Wallace’s review](/object-index/191/) two months earlier, Schonberg’s article includes reproductions and detailed captions of graphs BB and O from John Cage’s *Solo for Piano*, as well as *No. 1* from Sylvano Bussotti’s *Five Pieces for David Tudor*. The feature also emphasizes the great significance Cage and Tudor currently had on the visual arts. It is often noted that Cage and Morton Feldman spent more time with artists and dancers than they did with fellow composers and musicians. But Schonberg adds that the audiences for their performances were also dominated by the presence of artists and other non-musicians."

Enrique Franco eschews the discussion of individual works on the program, and instead, perhaps recognizing the international momentum that by 1960 has built up around a resurgent avant-garde, stages a deeper sociological critique of the “industrializers of ‘snobbery’ and the ‘bluff’” (*industrializadores del “snobismo” y del “bluff”*). Franco expresses a concern over the status of artistic authenticity and sincerity, a theme that recurs in the reception of Afro-modernism during the 1960s and becomes a salient theme of Stanley Cavell’s 1967 article, “Music Discomposed.” Like other European critics of the time who see theater, cabaret, comedy, and slapstick in John Cage and Tudor’s concerts, Franco judges the experimental event to be a mere “spectacle.”"

It reproduces notations by Sylvano Bussotti (*No. 4* of *Five Piano Pieces for David Tudor*) and Karlheinz Stockhausen (*Zyklus*). The substance of the review is a conservative rejection of noise and chance and links the avant-garde to its military strategy whose enemy is the audience. With an Artaudian flair, Schandorf hears in Cage and Tudor’s music “screams of anguish from a barren future land” (*angstskrig fra et goldt fremtidsland*). The second half of the review is more charitable and credits the avant-garde with a reasonable historical claim to be a developmental outgrowth of a long history of experimentation and noise in Western concert music."

In addition to describing a great number of specific scores and their demands on the performer, Tudor describes a philosophy that abjures “muscular rhythm” in favor of the possibility of “irregular rhythm” that is based in the “bloodstream” and “body feeling” that can be elicited in sight-reading techniques and customized notations “when visual and aural impressions overlap.” In his lecture, Tudor notes that this latter idea is indebted to Morton Feldman’s approach to composition."

    extended_caption: "Benjamin Patterson’s colleague Wolf Vostell had branded his work décollage, a technique of disassembling, deconstructing, or removing material from an object to create a work. In this score written for an exhibition by Vostell, Patterson riffs on John Cage’s use of transparencies in scores, which Cage first used in 1958 in *Variations I* and *Fontana Mix.* The first transparency is a timeline with hashmarks indicating various actions of removal (“tearing, cutting, sawing, grinding, sanding, chiseling, scraping, burning, eating,”) from four surfaces marked “A,” “B,” “C,” and “D.” The underlying paper contains various regions that specify the surface to be deconstructed (or a rest, if no letter is in the region where the hashmark appears). Two additional transparencies indicate the dynamics of each individual action. In providing a score for a practice Vostell had already developed, Patterson reveals a latent game-like procedure in his fellow artist’s work that can be subject to formalization and chance procedures (via the free distribution of the transparencies). The presence of a timeline and dynamic markings reveals Patterson’s continued interest in elements of traditional musical notation."

Notwithstanding the unique way Patterson used insects to derive material, the score itself is one of his more straightforward; as with David Tudor’s realization sheets, each page covers thirty seconds, leading to a performance of exactly six minutes if all twelve sheets are played. As was also the case with Tudor’s realization, the pages themselves can be freely resequenced."

As one of the earliest journalistic accounts of Fluxus, it is remarkable on multiple accounts. Williams was a Fluxus insider, highly informed about the group’s activities, and yet he plays the role of a bemused novice to the avant-garde scene as he previews the Fluxus festival and asks questions of (then Paris-based) participant Benjamin Patterson, including about his approach to interpreting unconventional scores. Williams’s naïve posturing appears to be for the benefit of the readership of *The Stars and Stripes*: United States military personnel stationed abroad. Williams worked as editor for the newspaper, and he was not the only Fluxus affiliate to be employed by the US military. For a time, Patterson played in the Seventh Army Symphony, and George Maciunas worked as a graphic designer stationed with the U.S. military base in Wiesbaden, where the watershed Fluxus festival was soon to take place."

It may have been assembled by George Maciunas, the book’s designer, as a bound proof. In this rare 1962 edition, the named copublishers are Maciunas and Jackson Mac Low, whereas the 1963 edition names Mac Low and Young. Also unlike the 1963 edition, this preliminary version contains text pieces by Robert Morris that Morris later removed while the collated yet unbound pages of *An Anthology* were being stored at his New York loft. Copies of the 1963 edition still include a Robert Morris title page but none of his texts, since the recto of that leaf is the last page of a Richard Maxfield essay and could not be removed. The copy of *An Anthology* reproduced here, therefore, is the most complete representation of this publication that exists, while also being distinct from all others in circulation."

      From his earliest days as a college student, John Cage was known as a charismatic speaker. After turning to chance procedures and indeterminate notations in the 1950s, Cage’s music could sound austere and inaccessible; in this context, spoken lectures helped audiences connect with the philosophical complexity and playfulness of his compositional process—without, however, fully explaining that process. With [*45′ for a Speaker*](/object-index/238/#fig-238-s) (1954), Cage first realized his ideal lecture practice, which would, in his words, “permit the audience to experience what I had to say rather than just hear about it.” Cage used chance procedures to determine many of its elements, from the subject matter discussed and quotations selected, to how fast or loud to read, and even when to cough or “lean on elbow.” The result is a peculiarly intense amalgamation of philosophical propositions, program note–like discussions of avant-garde techniques, ordinary gestures, and—of course—silences.

      The experimental poet Jackson Mac Low originally published the above poem *Asymmetry 222* in 1980, building on a continuous writing practice begun in 1960 of generating poetry from words, punctuation, typography, and spacing of words on the page that have been determined by certain kinds of chance operations, often using text taken from his current reading as source material. Based on this poem fragment, Simone Forti created a dance work, which she performed in a duet with fellow dance innovator Steve Paxton in 1982. It was staged at a celebration for Jackson Mac Low’s sixtieth birthday, held in New York’s Washington Square church. Here, dancers/choreographers Phoebe Berglund and Andros Zins-Browne perform a new interpretation of these words and movements. —Sarah Cooper

      The [score for Earle Brown’s *December 1952*](/object-index/301/) is little more than a series of horizontally and vertically oriented black rectangles spread out on a square piece of paper. One of the earliest instances of graphic notation, *December 1952* is largely open to the choices of the performer: the page may be oriented in any direction, while the shapes represent sound events in time, with various intensities, aggregates of pitches, or durations (though no key is supplied as to how that might work). Influenced by the delicately twisting mobiles of Alexander Calder, the spontaneity of Jackson Pollock’s abstract expressionism, and the Afro-modernist traditions of jazz improvisation, Brown’s early drafts of *December 1952* proposed a physical three-dimensional mobile of ever-changing rectangular shapes that would inspire a performer (he originally imagined a pianist) to be similarly spontaneous in “reading” the notation. The published version of the score, which he produced with the aid of random number tables, was intended as a snapshot of these mobile forms, in what Brown came to call a “conceptual mobile.” Unlike John Cage’s chance-based works of the period, which required a disciplined execution detached from expressive choices, Brown’s works were known for their openness to improvisation. It stands among the more pictorial contributions to *An Anthology of Chance Operations*.

      Following the length, width, and height of the score’s rectangles, this realization uses three sonic characters: dopplers, rhythmic clicks, and an arpeggiated bass. The clicks act like a net (infinitely expandable or contractible, and flexible to any topography), the dopplers are the direction and acceleration, and the bass sequences are buoys, constellating the resulting, continuously changing mass. In the same way this score can be infinitely scaled up or down (whether on a piece of paper or in the Getty’s courtyard), this “mass” travels between the extremes of spectrums: left to right, tonal to atonal, high to low frequencies, density to silence, fast to slow, rhythmic to random. By spending so much time in the extremes, this piece intends to join the poles into a circle, resisting linearity. (For example, 20 BPM and 999 BPM have more in common than with most tempos between them: the rhythm is indecipherable, and there are more durations of uniformity, whether of silence or density.) In this way, I hope to honor Earle Brown’s intention to “have elements exist in space . . . space as an infinitude of directions from an infinitude of points in space . . . [and] to work (compositionally and in performance) to right, left, back, forward, up, down, and all points between . . . [with] the score [being] a picture of this space at one instant, which must always be considered as unreal and/or transitory . . . [A] performer must set this all in motion (time), which is to say, realize that it is in motion and step into it . . . either sit and let it move or move through it at all speeds.” (Earle Brown, “Prefatory Note” [1961] to *Folio and 4 Systems*). —Celia Hollander

      Working by day as a research chemist, George Brecht became involved in Fluxus by way of [John Cage’s experimental composition course](/object-index/556/) at the New School for Social Research and was one of the earliest innovators of the text-based performance instructions known as “event scores.” His [*Motor Vehicle Sundown (Event)*](/object-index/379/) was the first to include “event” in its title, signaling the artist’s scientific observation of everyday phenomena. [This score was among Brecht’s contributions to *An Anthology of Chance Operations*.](/object-index/238/#fig-238-f) Brecht recounts: “In the Spring of 1960, standing in the woods in East Brunswick, New Jersey, where I lived at the time, waiting for my wife to come from the house, standing behind my English Ford station wagon, the motor running and the left-turn signal blinking, it occurred to me that a wholly ‘event’ piece could be drawn from the situation” (“The Origin of ‘Events’” [August 1970], in *Happening & Fluxus*, ed. Harald Szeemann and Hanns Sohm [Cologne: K.lnischer Kunstverein, 1970], n.p.). Brecht seized a moment from the flow of quotidian experience and recomposed it as a set of actions for anyone to perform, the sequence of which is randomized via a shuffled deck of instruction cards.

      An origin for Simone Forti’s *Onion Walk* can be located in a performance at Merce Cunningham Dance Studio in spring 1961: Forti read aloud what she called a “dance report” about an onion sprouting and falling from [its perch on the mouth of] a bottle. Shortly thereafter, [the text was included in the influential scores compilation *An Anthology of Chance Operations*](/object-index/238/#fig-238-bg), along with four other brief texts about movement observed and/or performed. The sculptural assembly has only recently been formalized as an object-based artwork through Forti’s participation in museum exhibitions. Not quite an action and not quite an object, the onion’s movement will be witnessed by few (if any) visitors. In this form, its quiet simplicity comments on the interactivity of systems, the virtue of patience, and the tiny shifts that generate change and hope. It also points out how other artworks might really be onions—growing and changing—even if this is not immediately apparent to viewers. —Megal Metcalf

      Originally published in *An Anthology of Chance Operations*, [*Beach Crawl*](/object-index/238/#fig-238-u) is an early work by Walter De Maria, who would gain renown as a minimalist sculptor and pioneer of monumental earthworks. Presaging those terrestrial experiments, this score instructs [performers] to crawl on their hands and knees while moving three rocks in a circular pattern down a sandy stretch of beach. In the hands of choreographer Phoebe Berglund, these instructions are transformed into a new work of dance. Her dancers’ crawl is punctuated with moments of meditation and tender contact, unfolding in concert with the natural elements and the ethereal sonic atmosphere performed by composer Joseph Allan Johnson. —Sarah Cooper

      This recording of [one of Jackson Mac Low’s scores included in *An Anthology*](/object-index/238/#fig-238-av) features the experimental vocalist Jeanne Lee alongside Mac Low. Following studies in literature and dance, Lee collaborated extensively with jazz pianist Ran Blake in the early 1960s before pushing her practice in increasingly intermedial directions, ultimately working between music, poetry, and dance. Here we can appreciate the ways in which Lee incorporates vocal jazz techniques, such as scatting, into a broader palette of sound poetry. In addition to collaborating with Mac Low, Lee worked with John Cage, Dick Higgins, Alison Knowles, and Dieter Roth before returning to the jazz world in the 1970s. Lee’s remarkable extended vocal practice unsettled the boundaries between the multiple experimental performance worlds in which she participated, from jazz to sound poetry.

    extended_caption: "From December 1960 to June 1961, La Monte Young hosted an experimental concert series in Yoko Ono’s loft at 112 Chambers Street in downtown Manhattan. Each concert focused on an individual artist. Featured artists included Terry Jennings, Toshi Ichiyanagi, Henry Flynt, Joseph Byrd, Jackson Mac Low, Richard Maxfield, La Monte Young, Simone Forti, and Robert Morris, with many more concerts planned but never executed. The performances and installations presented at this modest, cold-water flat served as a catalyst for the emerging trend of intermedia that would soon be documented in [*An Anthology*](/object-index/238/#fig-238-a). The concerts were attended by multiple generations of avant-garde artists and patrons, including John Cage, Marcel Duchamp, Peggy Guggenheim, Jasper Johns, and Robert Rauschenberg. Rigorous experimentalism was valued above all, as Young’s motto, printed on most of the series’ programs stated: “THE PURPOSE OF THIS SERIES IS NOT ENTERTAINMENT.”"

The document proposes legislating how the “Fluxus” name can be used and how fees will be collected whenever affiliated artists’ works are performed. Maciunas’s intent was to support his artist peers while solidifying and protecting the collective aims of Fluxus, but his conditions were immediately controversial and provoked a harsh backlash. The proposal to centralize, trademark, and monetize Fluxus activities was seen as overly controlling and against the spirit of the movement. The conditions were never adopted."

He submitted poems relentlessly to mainstream U.S. poetry publications before and during the McCarthy Red Scare era, apparently without realizing that he was being blacklisted for his radical political views. This program for La Monte Young’s series at Yoko Ono's loft celebrates Mac Low as a composer of performance works that, if not strictly musical in nature, are intended to be performed in a “concert” setting. While many of the other composers featured in this concert series became well-known members of the 1960s avant-garde, Mac Low’s contributions have been less frequently recognized, falling through the cracks that separate monodisciplinary narratives in art history, literary studies, and performance studies."

Each concert focused on an individual artist. Featured artists included Terry Jennings, Toshi Ichiyanagi, Henry Flynt, Joseph Byrd, Jackson Mac Low, Richard Maxfield, La Monte Young, Simone Forti, and Robert Morris, with many more concerts planned but never executed. The performances and installations presented at this modest, cold-water flat served as a catalyst for the emerging trend of intermedia that would soon be documented in [*An Anthology*](/object-index/238/#fig-238-a). The concerts were attended by multiple generations of avant-garde artists and patrons, including John Cage, Marcel Duchamp, Peggy Guggenheim, Jasper Johns, and Robert Rauschenberg. Rigorous experimentalism was valued above all, as Young’s motto, printed on most of the series’ programs stated: “THE PURPOSE OF THIS SERIES IS NOT ENTERTAINMENT.”"

The concert evidenced the international reach of John Cage’s music and ideas. It was also remarkable for being among the first public presentations in the United States of Ono’s compositions that would be collected in *Grapefruit* (1964), her now-famous compendium of poems, scores, and other writings."

    extended_caption: "The score for Earle Brown’s *December 1952* is little more than a series of horizontally and vertically oriented black rectangles spread out on a square piece of paper. One of the earliest instances of graphic notation, *December 1952* is largely open to the choices of the performer: the page may be <a class='ref' data-annotation-ids='' data-figure-id='fig-301-c' data-sequence-index='30' data-sequence-transition='30'>oriented in any direction</a>, while the shapes represent sound events in time, with various intensities, aggregates of pitches, or durations (though no key is supplied as to how that might work). Influenced by the delicately twisting mobiles of Alexander Calder, the spontaneity of Jackson Pollock’s abstract expressionism, and the Afromodernist traditions of jazz improvisation, Brown’s early drafts of *December 1952* proposed a physical three-dimensional mobile of ever-changing rectangular shapes that would inspire a performer (he originally imagined a pianist) to be similarly spontaneous in “reading” the notation. The published version of the score, which he produced with the aid of random number tables, was intended as a snapshot of these mobile forms, in what Brown came to call a “conceptual mobile.” Unlike John Cage’s chance-based works of the period, which required a disciplined execution detached from expressive choices, Brown’s works were known for their openness to improvisation.<br><br>This score also appears in the Getty Research Institute’s unique copy of [*An Anthology of Chance Operations*](/object-index/238/#fig-238-m) (1962), published by Jackson Mac Low and George Maciunas and edited by La Monte Young."

For his sound events, he chose a variety of tone clusters of varied sizes, dynamics, and durations. Though nothing in Earle Brown’s score precludes a dense or fast realization, many interpreters see and hear in it a relatively sparse and impersonal landscape of isolated sounds."

The original version prescribed a tone cluster on the piano to be performed exactly the same way each time. (Of course, in experiencing the piece, the imperfections between attacks inevitably attract one’s ear.) The duration is not required but encouraged to be long. (La Monte Young writes in the score: “I am particularly interested in longer periods of time.”) The “X” in the title is to be replaced by the number of attacks in that specific performance. In 1961, David Tudor famously performed *566 for Henry Flynt* at Darmstadt by striking a gong with a drumstick 566 times, provoking an audience member to call an ambulance, perhaps out of irritation or concern."

The text describes how a gradual elimination of the fine arts—characterized as part of an elitist, classist, wasteful, white-supremacist “snob culture”—must accompany the communist revolution. The arguments and visual appendices marry Flynt’s call for a proletarian, anti-racist cultural revolution with Maciunas’s obsession with design efficiency, which in this case addressed everything from cars and electronic musical instruments to social housing, represented by earnest designs for a prefabricated building system. This set of proposals was directed at a dual audience of communists in both the Soviet Union and the United States. The vision outlined here was not shared by all Fluxus affiliates."

He was then hired at Columbia University to teach musicology in 1934. Lang also served as a critic for the *Herald Tribune* during the heyday of the New York avant-garde. His article below is openly hostile toward the avant-garde (accusing it of nonsense, destructive desires, and latent conformity). He bases his opinions on the Audio-Visual Group concert under review, an event that was something of a hybrid of a David Tudor recital and a proto-Fluxus event. The review is entirely scathing, describing works by Al Hansen and Dick Higgins as childish, unthinking, “nightmarish,” and primitive, not to mention that they exposed bodily rituals and habits (burping, grunting, bathing, etc.). Christian Wolff and John Cage are also described as seriously misguided. Notably, Tudor comes off as the one respectable figure."

The style of this review employs parataxis, almost imitating the discontinuous qualities of the performances. Unlike [ Paul Henry Lang’s review](/object-index/334/), Schonberg “gets” the intermedial play of having a non-musician artist like Dick Higgins take a bath onstage and perform a live “drip painting” in the manner of Jackson Pollock. He seems to have a sense of how to “enjoy” the show. Ironically, John Cage comes off as the conservative here, given David Tudor’s performance of *Music of Changes* (1951), an eight-year-old work for piano solo largely based in conventional notation."

The concert under review is remarkable for being among the first public presentations in the United States of Ono’s compositions that would be collected in *Grapefruit* (1964), her now-famous compendium of poems, scores, and other writings. Readers will note the pronounced gender bias in how Parmenter treats Mayuzumi and Ichiyanagi (two male artists) and how he discusses Ono and Simone Forti (two female artists). For instance, Forti is referred to as Simone Morris or simply “the girl”; today, her work is much better known and appreciated."

      After George Brecht’s intensive period of composing event scores had ceased, he wrote this piece, titled *Event Score*, in August of 1965. As a reflection on the meaning and function of the intermedial format he had developed and honed, it considers the event score’s relationship to conscious and unconscious perception. Around the same time, one finds the following reflection in his notebook: 
      
      > These notices are thoughts that came from zero. Very few of the hundred or so that were written down came directly from a specific experience. Though they are simply what they are (appropriately poems for some), they are connected in my mind with musical scores; they have so far seemed to me scores for events. (Why only listen?) They are thoughts that can float around in your head, and then sometime perhaps

    extended_caption: "Among George Brecht’s most well-known compositions, *Drip Music (Drip Event)* (1959–62) bears many characteristics that typify the artist’s event scores, and the way it is dated suggests Brecht honed the text gradually and carefully over the course of his most intensive years of score writing. In 1960, Brecht began to call his works “events” as opposed to “music,” though this score retains both titles. Its first line immediately opens the possibility of the work’s performance to a multiplicity of realizations, by either a solo performer or a group, and even by nonhuman actors. (All possibilities would be experimented with by Fluxus artists, as [chapter 6’s Archive section](/06/#archive) shows.) Notably, the language avoids both an imperative tone as well as outwardly naming the agent of the action. Instead, it describes in a rather passive way the existence of the phenomenon of water dripping, leaving the words “source” and “vessel” open to interpretation. The even more ambiguous “second version” included in the score’s text might be written for more advanced readers familiar with Brecht’s work, such as the virtuoso listener for whom, as the artist described in his 1959 notebook, “all sound may be music” (George Brecht, notebook page ca. late July 1959, from Cage’s course in Experimental Composition, reprinted in *George Brecht—Notebooks*, ed. Dieter Daniels and Hermann Braun, vol. 3 [Cologne: Walther König, 1991], 123). At this time Brecht also wrote the similar yet slightly more elaborate score [*Comb Music (Comb Event)*](/object-index/349/#card-071) (1959–62)."

      On 18 June 2002, Benjamin Patterson staged a realization of George Brecht’s [*Drip Music (Drip Event)*](/object-index/346/) (1959–62) at the Paris venue La Ménagerie de Verre as part of a fortieth-anniversary celebration of Fluxus organized by Bertrand and Claudia Clavez. Patterson’s interpretation, executed that evening by Johan Barbereau, Fleur Spolidor, and Gilles Costantini (pictured left to right), featured a custom instrument designed and built by Patterson and Bertrand Clavez. The apparatus included three water bottles (principally meant for feeding animals) adapted to drip continuously onto an overturned plastic garden container whose shape was designed to hold three flowerpots. Contact microphones amplified the sound of water dripping onto the container’s drum-like surface.
      
      As Patterson explained of his motivation, “I decided to re-examine the original score, rather than rely on my memory of performances of the traditional interpretations of these works. Thus, I discovered that Brecht’s original instructions allowed for both a single source or multiple sources of dripping water. Remembering George’s first career as a chemist, employing laboratory equipment to produce multiple, dripping sources seemed appropriate” (personal correspondence from Benjamin Patterson to Alan Dunn, 2008). Bertrand Clavez elaborates: “The idea was to recall the scientific/lab/chemistry origins of the score (reminiscent of [*Burette Music*](/object-index/387/) [1959]) by staging a device served by three performers wearing protection glasses, gloves, and lab coats. Each of them would carry a glass of water, pour it into the bottle, step back, and then listen carefully to the sound” (personal correspondence from Bertrand Clavez to Natilee Harren, 2017).

      In 2008, the artist and designer Perry Garvin formed the performance group FLUXCONCERT to explore Fluxus event scores though a series of public performances. This documentation shows Garvin performing George Brecht’s [*Drip Music (Drip Event)*](/object-index/346/) (1959–62) at Triskelion Arts in Brooklyn, New York, in February 2009. Garvin can be seen following the performance convention of using a ladder, but he innovates with his use of a cloth to help control and accentuate individual drips.
      
      Here, living Fluxus artists (Alison Knowles, among others, was in the audience) witnessed a younger generation of artists and musicians, many born long after the original wave of Fluxus activities had ceased, return to these historical pieces and animate them anew. This footage shows that the event clearly belongs to a new technological era, in which images and video documentation can be snapped with a cell phone camera and easily shared online. Nevertheless, the audience response is remarkably similar to [earlier performances from over fifty years ago](/object-index/356/).
      
      In contrast to the [1979 concert at The Kitchen](/object-index/358/), Garvin’s goal in 2008 “was not to create historical recreations but simply to reanimate the works in the fleeting present,” privileging “the radically democratic and anti-institutional approach the work embodied.” More specifically, Garvin recalls of his realization of *Drip Music*: “I remember trying to be as immobile as possible during the dripping so that all audience attention would be focused on the water and the sound. My quick inversion of the empty vessel at the end was intended to mark the conclusion of the event and, practically, to prevent spillage!” (correspondence from Perry Garvin to Natilee Harren, 2017).

They perform the piece not in a concert hall but arrayed on an outdoor staircase, which takes the place of the conventional ladder.

      This 1962 film newsreel, broadcast on German public television, provides the earliest and most vivid documentation of Fluxus performance practices. It showcases and narrates selections from the 8 September concert of the [Fluxus Internationale Festspiele Neuester Musik](/object-index/229/), held in the auditorium of the Museum Wiesbaden from 1 to 23 September. The 8 September concert included works by George Brecht, Joseph Byrd, George Maciunas, Benjamin Patterson, Dick Higgins, Jackson Mac Low, Emmett Williams, Robert Watts, La Monte Young, and Philip Corner. The performers included Maciunas, Patterson, Higgins, Williams, Alison Knowles, and Nam June Paik.
      
      Advancing upon the increasingly theatrical works that David Tudor had introduced to Darmstadt’s *Neue Musik* (new music) scene, Maciunas posited the Fluxus concert program as *neuester musik* (newest/latest music) in a further challenge to German audiences that received divided response. The newsreel opens with a view of concert flyers defaced with the phrase “DIE IRREN SIND LOS” (the crazies are loose) and goes on to characterize the concerts’ reception as split between sympathetic comparisons to the work of Eugène Ionesco, Samuel Beckett, and Dada, and hostile analogies to headache-inducing circus antics. Indeed, the film captures a remarkable range of reactions from audience members, who express variations of pleasure, captivation, boredom, confusion, disgust, and surprise.
      
      The first piece we see performed is Byrd’s *Piece for Richard Maxfield* (1960), in which the performers simply clap as they stand onstage. “Do we have to remain serious?” the narrator asks, imagining audience members’ thoughts. Then follows Maciunas’s *In Memoriam to Adriano Olivetti Version 2* (1962) and Patterson’s [*Variations for Double-Bass*](/object-index/217/) (1961–62). Next, Williams’s *Four-Directional Song of Doubt for Five Voices* (1957) consists of five performers saying, in differing sequences, the words “you just never quite know.” We then see extraordinary footage of Paik performing La Monte Young’s [*Composition 1960 #10 to Bob Morris*](/object-index/238/#fig-238-bq), which instructs, “Draw a straight line and follow it”; Paik’s realization was so singular it became known as a signature Paik piece, titled *Zen for Head*. The narrator highlights it as the least musical work on the program. The concert’s finale is Philip Corner’s *Piano Activities* (1962), in which the performers attack a piano with implements including a brick, a hammer, a tea kettle, a shoe, a feather duster, and wooden two-by-fours. This interpretation of Corner’s piece reportedly offended some Germans who valued the piano as a sacred item. Meanwhile, Maciunas claimed that the already damaged secondhand instrument would not have made it out of the theater in one piece. As the performers lug the irreparable piano offstage through the hall’s emergency exit (*Notausgang*), the narrator concludes: “Oh blessed Mozart, have no fear, your music may still use the main entrance.”

Some of the pieces are explosive, with a punchline, while others draw our attention to intimate small-scale events.” Also of note is the capsule definition of Fluxus given in the first paragraph of the second page, which remarks on the group’s interest in “social transformation” and claims for Fluxus an instrumental role in “the formation of performance art as we know it.”"

There, George Maciunas directed two performances of George Brecht’s [*Drip Music (Drip Event)*](/object-index/346/) (1959–62). In the first, Maciunas imitated [Dick Higgins’s earlier performance that incorporated a ladder](/object-index/360/). In the second, shown here, he directed an ensemble performance equipped with eye droppers.

    extended_caption: "While the 1962–63 European Fluxus concert tour unfolded overseas, George Brecht presented his event scores in experimental performance programs in the New York area. In April 1963, Peter Moore captured Brecht’s realization of a dripping event at the concert [*Happenings, Events, and Advanced Musics*](/object-index/341/), organized by Al Hansen at Douglass College, Rutgers University. The program indicates that Brecht was performing his [*Three Aqueous Events*](/object-index/380/) (1961), but Moore’s photograph is often identified as depicting a realization of [*Drip Music (Drip Event)*](/object-index/346/) (1959–62). Given that Brecht was not averse to simultaneous performances of his events, the confusion merely highlights the recurring thematics and tricky ontology of his works."

Consisting of a wet rag hung over the handle of a watering can, it was effectively a kinetic sculpture. The sign’s looping script (and creative misspelling) was likely written by French Fluxus artist Ben Vautier. Brecht would have approved of this iteration, having once remarked, “Once in a while I would make an object first and then make a card later . . . .

      In early 1963, George Maciunas made this two-sided broadsheet collage by gathering together reviews of the [first Fluxus concerts in Wiesbaden](/object-index/356/), [Düsseldorf](/object-index/361/), and [Copenhagen](/object-index/359/). The two sheets were designed to be glued together to make one long page that could be sent through the mail as a rolled-up scroll. Most of the clippings came from German and Danish newspapers, but some articles prove that news of the Fluxus events reached readers as far as Italy and Austria. (Mastheads from regional papers like the *Telegraph-Herald* in Dubuque, Iowa, may have been added by Maciunas for humorous effect.) The madcap layout, reminiscent of Dada and Surrealist publications of the early twentieth century, is characteristic of the Fluxus newspapers Maciunas would publish under varying iterations of the name *cc V TRE*.
      
      The layout also amplifies and revels in the many bemused accounts of reviewers, which accord with the kind of language one finds in [reviews of performances of John Cage’s radical music](/02/#press-clippings). To point to one example included here, the Associated Press piece penned by Richard O’Regan cheekily recounts of the Wiesbaden festival, “This wasn’t a barroom brawl. It wasn’t a political rally. It was a concert of ‘very new music and anti-music’ in Wiesbaden’s dignified art museum.” O’Regan’s account was published in the American military newspaper [*Stars and Stripes*](/object-index/230/), which had a Darmstadt office out of which Fluxus artist and participating performer Emmett Williams worked as features editor.

      This extraordinary letter from George Maciunas to George Brecht, sent in early 1963, provides a highly detailed record of the artists’ collaborative design process and their ongoing deliberations over the intellectual significance of Brecht’s events and their transcription as event scores.
      
      In the <a class='ref' data-figure-id='fig-369-a' data-annotation-ids=''>first part</a> of the letter, Maciunas draws a diagram that imagines the relation between optical and acoustical elements in a work of art, possibly in response to Brecht’s remark in another letter that, “a minimum condition for my work . . . is a lack of distinction between ‘optical,’ ‘acoustical’ and other such categories” (Brecht to Maciunas, early 1963, Hanns Sohm Archive, Staatsgalerie Stuttgart). To this, Maciunas adds the dimension of artificial versus concrete (or “reality”). With reference to scores by Brecht that had been performed during the European Fluxus concert tour—namely [*Piano Piece*](/object-index/349/#card-079) (1962; “a vase of flowers on(to) a piano”) and [*Word Event*](/object-index/349/#card-035) (1961; “EXIT”)—Maciunas considers the fine line between art and non art, between deliberately formed and ready-made gestures, and between conceptual and perceptual experience that the scores traverse, ultimately comparing their operation to Zen Buddhist philosophy.
      
      In <a class='ref' data-figure-id='fig-369-b' data-annotation-ids=''>section two</a> of this letter, Maciunas discusses the disposition of [*Water Yam*](/object-index/348/) (1963) in terms of future editions and copyright and introduces the idea of a renewable subscription model or “perpetual” box. He mentions Fluxus newsletter no. 5, which he wrote and distributed to the Fluxus network in January 1963, as “a draft for a written agreement.” In that controversial newsletter, Maciunas proposed that affiliate artists assign to Fluxus the copyright and exclusive publication rights for their works in order to present a “common front” for Fluxus activities and to achieve financial security (with individual artists retaining 80 percent of profits from the sale of their work). In section three, Maciunas reports on his research into international locations amenable to his dream of developing a self-sustaining, permanent Fluxus commune.
      
      In the <a class='ref' data-figure-id='fig-369-c' data-annotation-ids=''>fourth section</a> of this letter, Maciunas attaches samples of paper for the printing of the *Water Yam* event score cards for Brecht to choose from. An added note in Brecht’s handwriting shows his first choice of white for all cards.
      
      In two <a class='ref' data-figure-id='fig-369-e' data-annotation-ids=''>pages appended</a> to this letter, Maciunas returns to the topic of the design for *Water Yam*, addressing card size and sketching out playful box and label design ideas for Brecht’s consideration.

A July 1961 letter from Brecht to Tudor makes apparent that the work was added to the program without Brecht’s knowledge, and that his scores had a more rapid and wide distribution than anticipated. Brecht wrote, “Two people now have told me that a piano piece of mine is on the Darmstadt program. Hence curiosity; I don’t know of any such score in circulation. Have you any information on this?” Once Brecht’s confusion had been cleared, he wrote to advise Tudor, “Children’s alphabet blocks are convenient for 2.

Also on the evening’s program were works by John Cage, Toshi Ichiyanagi, La Monte Young, and Terry Riley. Given that the audible events generated in the performance are made incidentally to otherwise quite visually oriented, theatrical actions made by the performer, we learn from the recording less about how the piece was performed by Tudor than we do about the audience’s enthusiastic reaction—in the forms of several waves of riotous laughter. Listen for one slight piano tone around 1:33, possibly made when the performer attaches dried peas or beans to the piano keyboard with sticky tape."

      George Brecht’s notes read: 
      
      > We drop the idea of an ‘ideal’ eighth-note, and consider a notational eighth-note to be a direction for an action: it has an operational definition. There is a specific minimum amount of information required to define this action in terms of sound duration, frequency, amplitude, etc. Traditionally this information has been provided (for any specific eighth-note) by the context of the piece in which it occurs, and by traditional (or period styles) of performance.
      > 
      > In some recent music (e.g. the [Intersections](/object-index/012/) of Morton Feldman) some or all of the defining characteristics of a sound have been left unspecified. The part left undetermined by the composer is supplied by the performer out of his nature, from the nature of his instrument, or the nature of the situation (Christian Wolff: [Duo I](/object-index/238/#fig-238-bn)).
      > 
      > When sounds arise consistent with the nature of their source, there is music. (Each defines “consistency” and “source”: with Stockhausen the source is the composer, the consistency, conformance [sic] to his intention; with Cage the source is where the sounds come from, the consistency “naturalness” [wu-shih?]).
      > 
      > In performing this new music (with much compositional indeterminacy) the performer confirms his own nature, in exactly the way the composer, in composition, confirmed his. The “virtu” of virtuosity must now mean behavior out of one’s life-experience; it cannot be delimited toward physical skill. The listener responding to this sound out of his own experience, adds a new element to the system: composer/notation/performer/sound/listener, and, for himself, defines the sound as music. For the virtuoso listener all sound may be music.
      
      Brecht’s evocation of the Zen Buddhist term *wu-shih* in this passage signals an approach to experience and behavior that is ordinary, unaffected, and therefore “natural.” Brecht may have become familiar with the term via Alan Watts's book, *The Way of Zen* (1957).

There is an elegant consistency to the viewpoint which allows each of these elements to manifest its own nature, without imbalance, without imposition. Ambient sound penetrates the intended, is “included” in the music. It is relevant to the situation in which the music arises/relevant to the music, which is ever situational.

Brecht invited Wolf to test the idea with some of his own scores, which he enclosed. Indeed, experimental scores were on occasion published in newspapers in the years around 1960 to draw audiences’ attention to the visual elements of scores that would otherwise be invisible in performances."

Notably, this event took place in a time before the differences between “happenings” and the more focused minimalism of Brecht’s events had been parsed.

    extended_caption: "This selection of scores was sent by George Brecht and Robert Watts to the poet and potter M. C. Richards, whom the artists met through David Tudor. Brecht and Watts, who first met in 1957, sent these mailings to a broad swath of their artistic community as the first gesture in their multipart YAM Festival, which culminated in a month-long series of performances and exhibitions in the New York area in May 1963. Watts’s score cards can be distinguished from Brecht’s irregularly formatted compositions in black-and-white by their consistent business card–like dimensions and colored paper. Whereas the [Fluxus concert series unfolding simultaneously in Europe](/object-index/356/) approached such scores as prompts for activities to be performed publicly in concert hall settings, Brecht and Watts’s mailing accords with what might better be described as a conceptual or mail art practice, as well as Brecht’s notion of the scores as “little enlightenments I wanted to communicate to my friends who would know what to do with them” (George Brecht, “The Origin of ‘Events’” [August 1970], in *Happening and Fluxus*, ed. Harald Szeemann and Hanns Sohm [Cologne: Kölnischer Kunstverein, 1970], n.p.)."

      These two letters from George Brecht to Jill Johnston, the dance and theatre critic for *The Village Voice* who wrote about Brecht’s work on several occasions, document Brecht’s struggles to make Johnston understand his practice and its goals.
      
      In the first two-page letter, Brecht’s discussion of “choosing” reflects upon the lasting significance of Marcel Duchamp’s readymade—a quotidian object chosen by the artist and reframed as a work of art. Foundational to Brecht’s practice, the notion of the readymade was extended to include the sorts of readymade actions captured in his event scores (i.e., [“EXIT”](/object-index/349/#card-035)). Brecht is particularly interested in the passivity of noticing or perceiving an event as opposed to actively performing or arranging one, a subtle yet important distinction that recalls [George Maciunas’s letter to Brecht about perceptual versus conceptual experience](/object-index/369/) also reproduced in this publication. Brecht writes, “There is neither action nor inaction, but simply an event occurring spontaneously, unwilled, out of nowhere, nowhen.”
      
      The first letter also provides a catalog of Brecht’s art historical interests: Erik Satie, Kurt Schwitters, Duchamp, the Zen philosopher and calligrapher Hakuin Ekaku, and Man Ray. His mention of a “center” reflects his [ongoing conversation](/object-index/403/) with the poet and potter M. C. Richards, author of the 1964 book *Centering in Pottery, Poetry, and the Person*. Finally, the enigmatic date provided—“day of last council”—is keyed to the poet (and drummer for the Velvet Underground) Angus MacLise’s [*Year*](/object-index/416/) (1962), a poetic alternative calendar that Brecht frequently used to date his personal correspondence.
      
      In the second one-page letter, Brecht zeroes in on his relationship to chance operations and their pioneering use by Duchamp and John Cage. He explains that he is not committed indefinitely to chance operations but appreciates them as a means to de-subjectify the work of art and (perhaps impossibly) eliminate the determining role of the artist. “Beyond a certain point,” he writes, “the work is not ‘done’ (by anyone), but simply occurs.”

Richards from July 1963 captures the particular kind of conversation Brecht was able to have with a poet about the carefully composed language of his event scores. Explaining his aversion to using articles and connectives, Brecht admits, “My own leaning is toward having as little as possible do as much as possible.” The rest is a beautiful meditation on his sense of the extraordinariness of the ordinary and banal, his feeling that “all moments are equally miraculous.” Brecht’s references to “the center” and “centering” evince an awareness of Richards’s book-in-progress, *Centering In Pottery, Poetry and the Person*, which would be published the following year."

    extended_caption: "Jackson Mac Low created performance works in dozens of formats over the course of his career, often appending detailed instructions for how performers should go about realizing a given work. Many of his works involve iterative operations on found texts, such as the Bible, newspaper articles, and the proper names of friends and colleagues, so it is not an exaggeration to say that Mac Low’s primary creative focus was on the procedures for realization rather than the semantic or linguistic content of the works as realized. This series of six postcards sent to the bassist-composer Benjamin Patterson in April 1963 show Mac Low consciously incorporating the elements of the emerging format of the event score: short instructional texts, often written in the imperative mood, often containing dedications to fellow artists or potential performers, with little or no explicit performance instructions. Patterson’s own [*Methods and Processes*](/object-index/226/) (1962) was an important early collection of such scores, along with Brecht’s [*Water Yam*](/object-index/348/) (1963) and Yoko Ono’s *Grapefruit* (1964). As with later event scores by Allan Kaprow and Alison Knowles (see [chapters 9](/09/) and [11](/11/)), the activities are drawn from “everyday life” and do not presume specialized musical or artistic training on the part of performers. Nonetheless, Mac Low seems to be seeking the conceptual limits of such deskilled performance in a work like *Schedule (For George Brecht)* (1963), in which the repeated instructions to “Sleep awhile / Wake up / Do something” could conceivably be realized by any living person (or animal) regardless of their conscious intent to enact a performance of the work. In the three *Social Project* scores (1963), Mac Low calls upon this deskilled pool of potential performers to enact social change—to “find a way” to end poverty, war, and unemployment and “make it work.” The naively stated political messaging offers an implicit critique of the depoliticized, middle-class “everydayness” found in many of Kaprow’s happenings, as well as of the attention-seeking antiart agitprop of the “Fluxus Propaganda” activities proposed by Henry Flynt and George Maciunas in [*Fluxus News—Policy Letter, no. 6*](/object-index/418/) (6 April 1963). Always the anarchist, Mac Low championed activist communities that formed spontaneously, without coercion and without artistic or psychological manipulation of the audience-participants."

In dating his works according to MacLise’s calendar, Mac Low aligns his performance works with a very small coterie of fellow experimentalists who would have recognized the reference to MacLise, including La Monte Young, who used the day names from *Year* to title and date the tape recordings of the drone-based musical collective known as the Theatre of Eternal Music. The calendar format suggests that event scores are something to engage with as part of an individual’s daily activities, while also opening up the possibility of synchronous engagement with an activity or prompt on the same day by a network of practitioners who are geographically dispersed. Mieko Shiomi would further develop the idea of synchronized, globally dispersed performances in her [*Spatial Poem*](/10/) (1965–75; see [chapter 10](/10/))."

These roles are changeable if a participant approaches someone in the opposite role and announces a desire to switch. Rainer designates herself a performer but refuses to model exact movement, instead suggesting that it is her attitude that participants might follow. She explains the dynamics of spatialization between moving bodies, inanimate objects, and audience members. She then instructs performers to move about the space and to move one another as well as objects over the course of the session, which will end when all objects and persons are returned more or less to where they were at the start. Finally, in accordance with her uninflected, task-based approach to dance, she instructs participants not to take her use of words such as “carry” and “pass” as “points of departure for free association or creative improvisation, or interpretation, but rather as directives for very specific behavior and activity.”"

At times, all the dancers join together in one forward motion; at others, they split into groups of equal size or smaller pods (of one to three people) splinter away, crossing the others’ paths and eventually rejoining the larger group. From time to time, a sole dancer weaves through an existing group in motion. There is no narrative context, just the music of the “Tuba mirum” passage from Hector Berlioz’s *Requiem*, which provides a surprising contrast to the generic affect and unchanging pace of the dancers’ collective movement. This performance of *We Shall Run* was also [captured by Babette Mangolte in photographs](/object-index/447/)."

    extended_caption: "In this video created for Korean television broadcast, Yvonne Rainer explains that although she is performing a solo initially choreographed in 1966, she has mainly abandoned live performance in favor of making films. When she made *Trio A*, the idea was to generate “a continuum of movement” that would incorporate many details and different parts of the body and performance space but would maintain a sense of “serene continuity.” She had worked on the dance for six months, and it became the first section of [*The Mind Is a Muscle*](/object-index/456/) (1966–68). In the video, which appears to be a rehearsal for a public performance of the dance, a confident, mid-career Rainer moves across the wooden floor in thoughtful and elegant movements, incorporating bends at various joints, slight pauses in poses, and rolls on the floor, rarely executing the same motion twice. When this video appeared in 1982, it demonstrated that Rainer’s international reputation as a dancer was solidified, at a time when she had already directed her energies elsewhere, including toward filmmaking."

    extended_caption: "This canonical footage of Yvonne Rainer performing the solo *Trio A* was produced by the dance historian Sally Banes as a research document, and it is the earliest moving-image recording of the dance. While it often represents *Trio A* in exhibitions and multimedia publications such as this one, Rainer has critiqued her own performance here as being imprecise and unideal. She once wrote: “When I hear rumors of people learning *Trio A* from the video, I know that they have achieved only a faint approximation of the dance with little understanding of its subtleties” (Rainer, “*Trio A*: Genealogy, Documentation, Notation,” *Dance Research Journal* 41, no. 2 [Winter 2009]: 16). Still, the film’s early date confers a special status on this recording that has led to its reception as being particularly authentic. To understand *Trio A* it may be better to take a comparative approach, in which we perceive the dance as existing between the numerous artist-authorized iterations—from historical to more contemporary—that are available to us."

    extended_caption: "This excerpt from video artist Charles Atlas’s longer work *Rainer Variations* (other excerpts of which are included in [chapter 8](/08/)) shows a bemused Yvonne Rainer attempting to teach [*Trio A*](/object-index/440/) (1966) to famed modern dance artist Martha Graham, who is played by the choreographer Richard Move in drag. This dynamic collaboration between Rainer, Atlas, and Move brings together Rainer’s interest in both dance and the moving image as well as melodrama and humor, queer aesthetics and critique, dance history, and the practice of revisiting and remixing her past works. Describing Atlas’s *Rainer Variations* as a “faux Rainer portrait,” Rainer has remarked: “At play here is a skepticism about the conventions of the documentary form that purports to reveal the ‘real’ artist who ultimately remains a persona or crafty impersonator of her own idealized self-image” (liner notes to Charles Atlas, *Rainer Variations*, DVD, Electronic Arts Intermix, New York, 2002, n.p.)."

    extended_caption: "Here, Yvonne Rainer instructs two solo dancers—Shelley Senter and Linda K. Johnson—who are rehearsing [*Trio A*](/object-index/440/) (1966). The dancers have already memorized the basic outline of the choreography, and so Rainer focuses on fine-tuning their continuity of line and managing the harshness and rigidity of individual movements. Fluidity of motion and maintaining a natural affect are critical. The dancers unwittingly overemphasize each individual position in their rehearsal, whereas Rainer desires a fluid performance without clear distinction between the individual positions of the limbs. Toward the beginning of the recording, she spends several minutes clarifying a single motion: the drop of the right leg into a falling lean. “It is not a [parallel] passé,” she says, referring to the specialized vocabulary of ballet. Rather, using quotidian language, she describes it as a more fluid motion of the foot down to the ground by the left foot, preceded by a momentary suspension and followed by a fall forward. The whole gesture should be executed with an emphasis on cultivating and moving with the body’s organic, unexaggerated momentum."

      Performing nude with U.S. flags tied at their necks and draped over the fronts of their bodies, Yvonne Rainer and five dancers from the Grand Union dance troupe perform [*Trio A*](/object-index/440/) (1966) for a solemn, attentive audience at the opening of *The People’s Flag Show*. Organized by Faith Ringgold, Jean Toche, and Jon Hendricks at Judson Memorial Church, the group exhibition was staged against the backdrop of the Vietnam War in response to repressive laws regarding the display and use of the American flag. (A few days later, the organizers were arrested and then acquitted on charges of desecrating the flag.) Rainer adapted the presentation of her preexisting dance *Trio A* to highlight the fraught relationship between the flag and the identity and humanity of those it purports to represent, as well as to combine multiple taboos into what she has described as “a double-barreled attack on repression and censorship.” Surrounded by a multitude of artworks commenting on the flag, the dancers become objects of the spectators’ gaze, their bodies defined by the flag’s iconic design in ways akin to the audience members themselves, who are subjects similarly living under conditions defined by the American flag and all the causes it is used to justify.

My body remains the enduring reality.” In 1970, Rainer would reimagine her [*Trio A* as a protest dance](/object-index/445/) in the context of Faith Ringgold, Jean Toche and Jon Hendricks’s *The People's Flag Show*."

Don McDonagh characterizes the work as pluralistic, highly personal, engaged with the task-like manipulation of basic props, and invested in process over product. His judgment is ultimately negative, as he compares the overall effect to “the looks of an unorganized day,” but his observations are nevertheless an accurate portrayal of the means and aesthetics of Rainer’s contribution to experimental performance, process art, and postmodern dance, which her peers and later audiences would come to celebrate. Of note, the reviewer’s fixation on Rainer’s props getting in the way of “‘purer’ dance choreography” (the preferred element here) parallels the [response of critics to John Cage’s theatrical use of everyday objects](/object-index/121/) in his music compositions."

The dance has no eye, doesn’t look at anybody. I got this idea from noticing that the innumerable focal changes are always, with maybe one or two exceptions, up, down, side, diagonal or back, never directly at the audience, as though consciously designed to withdraw that contact which is the performer’s traditional trade-tool of seductive involvement. It is suggested the audience find the eye in the dance, not on the faces of performers.”"

    extended_caption: "Jill Johnston, a dedicated and sympathetic critic of the New York avant-garde, provides one of the first published accounts of the complete version of Yvonne Rainer’s multipart dance, [*The Mind Is a Muscle*](/object-index/456/) (1966–68) (in particular the section titled [*Trio A*](/object-index/440/)). Johnston already seems aware that it will be regarded as a canonical work of postmodern dance. The article is not only a review of a specific evening of the performance but it is also a historically informed effort to take stock of Rainer’s trajectory and to spell out the implications of her work on the fields of dance and performance broadly speaking. Johnston notes that *Trio A*’s “innumerable discrete parts” are “assimilated by a smooth unaccented continuity” that departs from the hierarchical and “plot-like” structure of conventional dance phrasing seen in ballet and modern dance. She notes Rainer’s hybridization of dance and everyday movement; the neutrality and matter-of-factness of the performers; and their disengagement from the audience in a kind of “tactical withdrawal.” Personal, melodramatic, and comedic materials are presented in a deadpan way, and there are provocative juxtapositions of contradictory movements and sounds. Johnston calls Rainer’s work “of the first magnitude (…since Cunningham’s radical alterations) in advancing the medium within a context of movement still understood as ‘dance.’” While the review is celebratory overall, Johnston does seem to agree with other critics that the multitude of props and set pieces amounts to a distraction. The dance critic [Deborah Jowitt’s take on *The Mind Is a Muscle*](/object-index/460/), also included in the Archive section of [chapter 8](/08/), appeared in the same issue of *The Village Voice* as Johnston’s review."

    extended_caption: "The dance critic Deborah Jowitt’s review of Yvonne Rainer’s [*The Mind Is a Muscle*](/object-index/456/) (1966–68) attends to the quality of the dancers’ movements even as they perform non-dancerly gestures, such as walking up and down a set of stairs or kicking their sneakered feet. She notes their rather unselfconscious focus on their activities, likening their behavior to that of athletes in training who are immersed in mastering a physical skill and unconcerned with being watched. In that sense, for Jowitt, the appearance of juggler Harry De Dio in the subsection *Act* becomes emblematic for the work as a whole. She distills Rainer’s project as consisting of movement exercises whose success emerges directly from their satisfactory execution, with little investment in theatrical expressionism. Of note, cultural critic [Jill Johnston’s take on *The Mind Is a Muscle*](/object-index/459/), also included in the Archive section of [chapter 8](/08/), appeared in the same issue of *The Village Voice* as Jowitt’s review."

    extended_caption: "The cultural critic Jill Johnston’s extensive two-part review of Yvonne Rainer’s multi-part dance *Terrain*, performed at Judson Memorial Church on 28 and 29 April 1963, provides a devoted close-read of a complex work. In part one, Johnston writes, “the total event is like stringing beads, or putting panels together, the way some painters do.” She focuses on the work’s basis in an algorithmic, game-like play of following rules and signals. Rainer’s strategy, which produces slightly differing results with each performance, is informed by John Cage and Merce Cunningham’s engagements with indeterminacy and also resonates with the operations of Fluxus event scores. [In part two](/object-index/461/#fig-461-b/) of the review, Johnston focuses on the outcomes of Rainer’s interest in play, relating her work to that of Cunningham, James Waring, and Aileen Passloff. Rainer’s dances *Play* and *Diagonal* appear “like watching any kids’ game on the street,” Johnston writes. “The whole idea of play was here treated with respect for its real sense.” Rainer also delivered a shocking duet on the theme of lovemaking that hewed unusually close to the real act, inspiring Johnston to pose deep questions about the proximity of art and life, and the role of the viewer between them. Crucial to the success of Rainer’s work, she concludes, are the sensitive talents of the dancers working alongside her: Trisha Brown, Judith Dunn, William Davis, Steve Paxton, and Albert Reid. Rather than completely sublimating their individual way of moving to a choreographic standard, “They looked like themselves even while rendering the material accurately.”"

Cass contrasts with the generous, attentive takes of [Jill Johnston](/object-index/459/) and [Deborah Jowitt](/object-index/460/) also included in [chapter 8](/08/). Unable to perceive and appreciate the dedication, concentration, and skill required to execute Rainer’s choreography, Cass describes it as vapid, tedious non-dance, while revealing her own rigid expectation and standard of “attenuated, proudly presented bodies,” which she did not see in evidence despite the real talents of Rainer’s collaborators. Cass’s review is emblematic of a reactionary modernist response to emerging postmodern dance currents of the time."

    extended_caption: "This one-page excerpt from the score for *Parts of Some Sextets* (1965) takes the form of a table, an unusual format for Yvonne Rainer. Choreographed for ten performers interacting with twelve mattresses, the participants included Rainer, Lucinda Childs, Judith Dunn, Sally Gross, Deborah Hay, Tony Holder, Robert Morris, Steve Paxton, Robert Rauschenberg, and Joseph Schlichter. The vertical axis of the chart lists thirty-one movement phrases, while the horizontal axis represents a sequence of thirty-second intervals. The letters in the body of the chart stand for the individual performers who are to execute the movements at a given time. During rehearsal, the score was posted to the wall for easy reference. The clear layout of information belies the difficulty of memorizing what was in practice a disconnected, nonintuitive sequence of gestures. Rainer has written, “Since there was no ‘organic’ or kinesthetic continuity, some of us found it extraordinarily difficult to learn and ended up memorizing it by rote, like multiplication tables or dates in history” (Rainer, “Some Retrospective Notes on a Dance for 10 People and 12 Mattresses Called *Parts of Some Sextets*, Performed at the Wadsworth Atheneum, Hartford, Connecticut, and Judson Memorial Church, New York, in March 1965,” in Mariellen R.

The subtleties and dynamics of this dance, performed without the structuring support of a musical score, seemed outside the domain of any graphic notation system. But when the opportunity arose in conjunction with teaching *Trio A* at the Greenwich Dance Agency in the summer of 2003, I did not object; in fact, I was curious. The notators were Joukje Kolff and Melanie Clarke. Their intense devotion to and completion of the task have given rise to some ruminations about conservation and immortality” (Rainer, “*Trio A*: Genealogy, Documentation, Notation,” *Dance Research Journal* 41, no. 2 [Winter 2009]: 16). "

    extended_caption: "Alison Knowles first published the score for *The Identical Lunch* in the last issue of *The Outsider*, a primarily Beat literary magazine published in small batches by Gypsy Lou and Jon Edgar Webb of the Loujon Press in New Orleans. Knowles’s text is joined by the work of colleagues Allan Kaprow, Dick Higgins, Jackson Mac Low, and Emmett Williams, but the more numerous texts by Beat writers in the issue strike an instructive counterpoint to Knowles’s quasi-objective and seemingly systematic reporting. While the Beat writers similarly dwell on everyday life in artist enclaves and working-class neighborhoods, they do so in a lyrical and markedly subjective way. See “Journal of the Identical Lunch,” *The Outsider* 2, no. 4/5 (Winter 1968/69): 182–84."

Knowles devised this realization on the basis of George Maciunas’s previously unrealized proposal to blend [the components of *The Identical Lunch*](/object-index/479/) to make a kind of fish soup. For this performance, she enlisted some friends and a group of students at the University of Chicago and the University of Illinois at Chicago. Each participant brought a blender and pressed the buttons in response to Knowles’s conducting gestures. Each blender emitted a distinct whirr, depending on age, brand, model, etc. At the end of the symphony, Knowles and the participants served the mixture in paper cups to the audience members, only some of whom were willing to try it."

    extended_caption: "Alison Knowles made these photo-silkscreen portraits in the early 1970s based on a series of Polaroids she had taken of her friends and audience members performing [*The Identical Lunch*](/object-index/479/) at the New Year’s Eve Flux-Feast at the Fluxhouse Cooperative in SoHo in 1969. Knowles recalled in a 2008 interview with the art historian Jessica Santone, “I got a shower curtain and I isolated a little space in the corner of the room and then I invited particular people to come and I served them a lunch. I had a toaster in there, and I’d mixed up the tuna fish and I had the lettuce. They’d sit down and eat the lunch there and I’d take a Polaroid of them eating and then they could talk to me about whatever” (Alison Knowles, in discussion with Jessica Lynne Santone, 22 October 2008, in Jessica Lynne Santone, “Circulating the Event: The Social Life of Performance Documentation, 1965–1975” [PhD diss., McGill University, 2010], 102). Overall, the portraits strike a balance between individual difference and sameness: the poses are distinctive, while the colors are fairly uniform, and the same corporate logo is stamped across them all—“Compliments of Star-Kist Foods, Inc.” Knowles’s suggestion of official sponsorship by the leading tuna brand StarKist was fraudulent, but she came much closer than one might expect. While teaching at CalArts, a student filmmaker told her that his father was the president of StarKist Foods, and his uncle was the manager of StarKist in California. Through this student, Knowles managed to get a complimentary crate of cans of tuna for another realization of *The Identical Lunch* at the University of California, Irvine."

    extended_caption: "Alison Knowles’s career as an artist began before the onset of the women’s liberation movement of the 1960s. In retrospect, she and others have identified a feminist impulse in her early work that involved making and serving food. But her sense of herself as a woman artist, one who might seek out collaborations and solidarities with other women, emerged after teaching at CalArts in the early 1970s, where Judy Chicago and Miriam Schapiro developed the Feminist Art Program. As she recalled later in an interview with former student Aviva Rahmani, Knowles’s experience at CalArts “forced me to take a harder look at myself and what my own history had been” (Aviva Rahmani, “Alison Knowles: An Interview,” in *M/E/A/N/I/N/G: An Anthology of Artists’ Writings, Theory, and Criticism*, ed. Susan Bee and Mira Schor [Durham, NC: Duke University Press, 2000], 364). Still, Knowles remained committed to collaborating with and mentoring artists of all genders, and this led to her occasional feeling of estrangement from the Feminist Art Program, which insisted on women-only cohorts and curricula. In this letter to collector Jean Brown, written sometime after Knowles returned to New York from California, one can see Knowles’s excitement about creating both a women’s household with Bici Forbes (Nye Ffarrabas), and a women’s avant-garde publication with Anna (now Annea) Lockwood. At the same time, however, Knowles stakes a position in opposition to “the partisanship within the women’s movement.” The [*Womens Work*](/object-index/497/) magazine she pitches here came to fruition in 1975; a second issue was published in 1978."

Photographs of Pauline Oliveros as a swaggering girl with a dagger and Knowles as a surly baby, as well as of Knowles’s young daughters absorbed in their own playing, ironically assert the existence (past and future) of women composers despite systemic gender discrimination."

As she recalled later in an interview with former student Aviva Rahmani, Knowles’s experience at CalArts “forced me to take a harder look at myself and what my own history had been” (Aviva Rahmani, “Alison Knowles: An Interview,” in *M/E/A/N/I/N/G: An Anthology of Artists’ Writings, Theory, and Criticism*, ed. Susan Bee and Mira Schor [Durham, NC: Duke University Press, 2000], 364). When she returned to New York, Knowles became friends with the composer Annea (then Anna) Lockwood, and together they put together *Womens Work*, a magazine of avant-garde scores written by women artists from around the world. Two issues were published, one in 1975 and another in 1978."

Each of us is doing a strip 6” wide, on an 18” square. The idea of this is something like an anti-gallery thing, anti-painting too. . . . These paintings could be easily duplicated for anyone at 10 or 15 bucks apiece. Since they are scrupulously identical, all the gallery has, Ferus or 3rd rail or Kornblee or what have you, is one of a few examples. It sort of undermines the whole gallery prestige thing entirely.” Here Knowles indicates that her exploration of “the identical” is at the same time a critique of the commodification of art. In this letter Knowles also offers a vivid description of the performances she saw at the YAM Festival. Her tepid appraisal of Allan Kaprow’s *Tree* (1963), “one of his large scale vaguely allegorical things,” hints at a future divide between those artists who identified with Fluxus and those who identified with “happenings.”"

As she writes in the introduction to this book, “Philip midwifed if not actually preconceived *The Identical Lunch*. . . .He caught me eating the same lunch at the same time at the same place each day. From that day on, the experience was elevated into a formal score.” Inspired by Knowles’s formalization, performance, and documentation of eating the lunch, Corner, in turn, undertook a parallel project at Riss Foods. He decided to realize Knowles’s score by ordering everything on the menu, “starting from ‘tunafish,’ which is the third down on the board, mov[ing] down the left, then up the right side of that board, and then on to the other boards which offer, for example, hot plates, salads, etc.” Many complications ensue and ethical decisions have to be made as the diner menu is rewritten and inconsistencies appear. Corner records his thinking about all that in this book, which sometimes addresses Knowles directly, thereby staging a conversation of sorts between this book and Knowles’s [*Journal of the Identical Lunch*](/object-index/511/)."

Knowles recalled in a 2008 interview with the art historian Jessica Santone, “I got a shower curtain and I isolated a little space in the corner of the room and then I invited particular people to come and I served them a lunch. I had a toaster in there, and I’d mixed up the tuna fish and I had the lettuce. They’d sit down and eat the lunch there and I’d take a Polaroid of them eating and then they could talk to me about whatever” (Alison Knowles, in discussion with Jessica Lynne Santone, 22 October 2008, in Jessica Lynne Santone, “Circulating the Event: the Social Life of Performance Documentation, 1965-1975” [PhD diss., McGill University, 2010), 102]. The resulting Polaroids then served as the material basis for Knowles’s [series of photo-silkscreens on canvas](/object-index/484/) that she made between 1970 and 1973."

It shows that Mieko Shiomi was at the time based in Osaka and that George Maciunas had committed to designing “special issues” of each event’s collected reports. One hundred sixty-seven visual artists, musicians, composers, dancers, poets, filmmakers, gallerists, and other interlocutors are named. By listing out the names of all Shiomi’s collaborators up to that point, the document served to reflect the artist’s expansive international network back to itself."

The piece was not only a response to her growing concerns about spatiotemporal limitations on creative activity; it anticipated her discovery of a broader solution to this problem, in [*Spatial Poem*](/object-index/530/#fig-530-g). The score invites participants to write a real or imagined location on a card and then attach it to a string, one end of which is tied to the performer’s fingers. The participant then affixes the string’s loose end to a point reaching toward the chosen direction."

Later taking up the notion of direction again for her [*Spatial Poem No. 2 (Direction Event)*](/object-index/519/) in 1965, Shiomi explained her poetic intent to George Maciunas: “I meant ‘direction’ not only direction on compass [*sic*], in this poem it is rather the state of consciousness of the relation between yourself and the outside world” ([Shiomi to Maciunas](/object-index/536/), ca. 1965, Getty Research Institute, Jean Brown Papers, 890164, box 31, folder 30)."

Each paper flag is printed with the text of one participant’s report, and the pin has been placed on the map at the approximate location where the event was performed. The stenciled cork sheet, probably made by Maciunas, is the second iteration of a design that initially featured a simple black line drawing of the Earth’s continents printed on [white foam board](/object-index/531/#fig-531-c), with numbers indicating where flags should be placed. In some cases, the numbered flags were housed in a separate box, allowing recipients to assemble the work themselves."

Much larger in scale, this foldout “fluxatlas” adopts a playful nautical theme and takes creative license with the scale of various landmasses. The enormous scale of Japan, at left, corresponds more to Maciunas’s estimation of the country’s avant-garde energy than to any geographic reality. This design, particularly its incorporation of graphic details appropriated from seventeenth-century engravings, was one that Mieko Shiomi initially protested. In a letter to Maciunas from around 1966, she wrote, “I’d like to show the people’s direction as transparently and exactly as possible. I’m afraid that too strong power of design’s image can weaken the contents” ([Shiomi to Maciunas](/object-index/538/), ca. 1966, Getty Research Institute, Jean Brown Papers, 890164, box 31, folder 30)."

The more than one hundred individual pages of the calendar, hung on the top two bolts, could then “fall” down to the bottom two bolts, or off the calendar altogether. Each page represents one realization of Mieko Shiomi’s event, originally performed between June and August of 1966. This calendar would surely be an erratic way to mark time, as many days are either repeated or missing."

As such, many of the reports she received included photographs of the resulting arrangement.

Here, both photographs and textual reports are reproduced on the individual cells of a microfilm reel, and the label refers to the work as a “fluxmovie.” This object edition was the final design Maciunas was able to complete for Shiomi’s larger *Spatial Poem* project."

Shiomi’s letter indicates that she initially experienced difficulties organizing a visit to New York, although she ultimately departed Japan in summer 1964 to make a yearlong trip. The letter attests to perceived differences between Fluxus circles in the United States and Japan, as Shiomi offers that Maciunas may “find in Japan FLUXUS people less individualism an[d] ego.”"

She reports on a Fluxus week of exhibitions and performances organized in September 1965 in Tokyo. Shiomi also weighs in on Maciunas’s growing conflict with Takahisa Kosugi, Nam June Paik, and Charlotte Moorman over their independent event organizing, particularly Moorman’s Avant-Garde Festival series, which Maciunas felt to be in competition with his Fluxus efforts. Shiomi advocates a nonhierarchical and expansive notion of collective avant-garde membership, since, as she explains, “our pieces contain almost endless possibilityies [*sic*] of performance.”"

In Japan, Shiomi could not find the same supplies with which she had begun the project in New York. Shiomi’s mention of Maciunas’s performance of [*Spatial Poem No. 2 (Direction Event)*](/object-index/519/) (1965) was reported as follows: “George Maciunas was spinning himself on a office chair very rapidly in the elevator which was going up, thus facing all directions and moving upward in New York.” This letter, like many others in the [Archive section of chapter 10](/10/#archive), also chronicles Shiomi’s efforts to help Maciunas get an antique samurai sword from his personal collection repaired in Japan."

It stands as Mieko Shiomi’s most explicit rebuke to Maciunas about his delimited vision and “rough and autocratic” manner in organizing Fluxus publications and events, which she warns may lead to “social suicide.” Citing the historical example of André Breton’s role in the demise of French Surrealism, she advocates a vision of Fluxus success in which “many artists have to be spontaneously co-operative having the same aim and desire”—a model that in many ways corresponds to the structure of her [*Spatial Poem* series](/object-index/530/)  (1965–75)."

The letter also includes mention of the Massachusetts-based collector of Dada and Surrealist ephemera Jean Brown, who recognized the importance of Fluxus among other contemporaneous neo-avant-garde tendencies and was beginning to collect works directly from artists. "

Interestingly, Shiomi’s account of the difficulty of this task reveals details about geopolitical relationships between the United States and Japan, as well as Shiomi’s newfound limitations since becoming a wife and mother. She reports that it is forbidden to send money from Japan to the United States, while lamenting that “my situation is like a prisoner in house.” Developing artistic collaborations that could be realized by mail established a lifeline that sustained her artistic practice during this difficult period in her life."

      > - Stand on the sandy beach with your back to the sea.
      > - Hold a mirror before your face and look in it.
      > - Then step back to the sea and enter into the water.
      
      Here the piece is performed by Tatiana Luboviski-Acosta, Taylor Doran, Yvonne Tam, and Dicky Bahto at various locations along the Pacific Coast.

    extended_caption: "John Cage taught experimental composition at the New School for Social Research [multiple times between 1956 and 1959](/object-index/556/). This course was famously “open to those with or without musical training” (as stated in the course catalog). Indeed, some of the key students enrolled in the Summer 1958 session were known primarily as visual artists and had limited musical training (e.g., Allan Kaprow, and especially Al Hansen). But it is also true that other regular members of the class—including Carol Galente (left) and Stephen Addiss (right)—came to the course with classical musical training and more conventional musical taste. In this photograph, Mac Low (center) plays a drum that was part of a large collection of traditional, albeit non-Western, percussion instruments kept in a closet in Cage’s classroom. The tensions and disagreements that arose from the students’ differing disciplinary backgrounds and philosophies helped to create a charged atmosphere conducive to risk-taking. There could be a measure of difference among the teachers’ perspectives, too: When Cage was on tour, Morton Feldman, Earle Brown, and Richard Maxfield would substitute for him, bringing their distinctive ideas about composition to the students."

While the course was very much hands-on, it also included much philosophical discussion, and some lectures by Cage, as the course description promised “a full exposition of the contemporary music scene in the light of the work of Anton Webern, and present developments in music for magnetic tape.” Many former students recall the transformative effect of Cage’s charismatic presence, and especially his rare combination of rigor and playfulness—seen here in Cage’s delighted smile. George Brecht was hardly alone when he explained in 1967 that Cage’s outsize influence on his students “came as much from Cage the person as from his works or ideas.”"

    extended_caption: "The program for *Comfort Zones* (produced by Galería Vandrés, S. A., Madrid, Spain; photographed and edited by David Seaton; and peformed by Esther Llordén and Mario Costas) makes it seem difficult to film, since so many of Allan Kaprow’s instructions call for actions that are radically internal, such as thinking and sensing. When the program has the performers communicate their thoughts and feelings, they say only “now”—a word that expresses little and yet emphasizes the non-coincidence of the “now” of the recording and the “now” of the screening. At the same time, *Comfort Zones* has an intensity and visceral quality due to Kaprow’s deliberately stylized film grammar, which includes extreme close-ups and slow motion. [Kaprow’s detailed shooting script](/object-index/628/) can be viewed in the [Archive section of chapter 11](/11/#archive), along with the [activity booklet](/object-index/626/) and the program in [English](/object-index/627/), that was used in this Madrid realization."

      *7 Kinds of Sympathy* was sponsored by Vienna’s Museum of the 20th Century and realized there by a few couples in March 1976. The videotape of the program was shot and edited by Peter Kirby, an alumnus of the California Institute of the Arts, where Allan Kaprow had been a dean and a professor from 1969 to 1974. Kirby ran the Artists Post Production Facility at the Long Beach Museum of Art in Long Beach, California, and founded an early video postproduction company in Hollywood (Video Transitions), where he worked on commercial music videos. Kaprow collaborated with Kirby on several additional videotapes for his activities, namely *Time Pieces* (1975), *Common Senses* (1977), and *Private Parts* (1977). You can also view [*Private Parts*](object-index/578/) in the [Playback section of chapter 11](/11/#playback). The remaining components of *7 Kinds of Sympathy*—[Kaprow’s activity booklet](/object-index/630/) and [notes for the video](/object-index/631/)—are reproduced in the [Archive section](/11/#archive).
      
      Produced by Peter Kirby and Anna Canepa Video Distribution, with performers Julie Steiny and Bryan Jones.

In his first environments from 1958, Kaprow played tapes on multiple tape recorders that he positioned in different parts of the gallery in order to create an immersive, and sometimes deliberately irritating, sound field. According to Kaprow’s recollection, it was his early tape practice that led him to seek out John Cage as a teacher."

    extended_caption: "Kaprow taught art history in the men’s college of Rutgers University in New Brunswick, New Jersey, from 1953 to 1961. During this time, he intersected frequently with the Fluxus artist Robert Watts, who taught across campus in the women’s college—Douglass College—from 1953 to 1984. Asked to organize an interdisciplinary lecture series at Douglass in 1958, Watts decided on the broad topic of “communication.” Thus it came to pass that, in between conventional lectures by various experts in the fields of chemistry, psychology, and literature, both John Cage and Allan Kaprow delivered untitled experimental lectures in the Voorhees Chapel (11 March and 22 April 1958, respectively). For Cage’s lecture, he read a series of questions and quotations that he determined via chance operations, while, simultaneously, David Tudor played the piano. For Kaprow’s lecture, he enlisted a few of his current students to perform a series of tasks and games, like dragging a tin can and unfurling banners from the balcony. Kaprow meanwhile sat in silence at the lectern while a lecture of his on the virtues of failed communication played back in a garbled polyphony of unsynchronized tape recorders. Kaprow later titled this lecture *Communication* and referred to it in his notes as his “first public happening.”"

He asks: How can one access another person’s experience except through highly formulaic phrases and gestures, which ipso facto falsify that experience? Kaprow’s paradoxical conclusion that “the only ‘communication’ that interests me is the communication of non-communication” resonates with many of his activities of the 1970s."

    extended_caption: "When Allan Kaprow was commissioned to compose and present a happening at a university, as he often was in the mid- to late 1960s, he would typically start by researching and selecting one or two settings. To this end, for [*Soap*](/object-index/585/), Kaprow consulted this chart, which shows the average times and heights for the highs and lows of the waves at Sarasota Bay in February. Viewed through the lens of the avant-garde, the chart looks like a readymade graphic score, and this is far from incidental in a practice like Kaprow’s, which tends to model his artistic forms on vernacular references."

It is also striking how Kaprow here seeks to gain control over the photographic documentation of his work by mandating that no one can photograph the happening without his permission and direction."

It is one of several happenings and activities for which Kaprow incorporated the action of photographic documentation into the program itself. Doing so was a clever way to “eliminate the audience” as Kaprow wished, while still generating compelling images for posterity and self-promotion. For this realization of *Transfer*, a Wesleyan student named Andrew Glantz played the role of photographer. Kaprow’s zeroing in on [“triumphal photo” language of the program](/object-index/594/) slyly acknowledges that photographs often misrepresent events by focusing on the high points at the expense of the events’ experiential gestalts. The stark contrast between the black-and-white photographs of *Transfer* and what we can imagine as the incredibly bright colors of the oil barrels drives home this line of questioning."

Here Kaprow suggests that they will make two different kinds of photographic texts—one a documentary “record,” the other “the actual film, photos, or tapes,” by which he means a scorelike instructional film, video, or booklet. This letter also indicates how systematic Kaprow’s activity form had become by that year. For example, he confidently predicts that 25 percent of those who attend his briefing will return the next day to participate in the realization. This systematic quality of activities is further reflected in Kaprow’s use of standardized, uniformly available materials in his programs, such as “pocket mirrors (3” × 4” @ 12c ea.).”"

    extended_caption: "Allan Kaprow likely composed this text to accompany an exhibition of his videotapes and activity booklets. Here he explains how photographic media can be used to create something like “music scores,” or “notations which one or more persons can carry out” after looking at them. The “How to” of the title of this text is a nod to Kaprow’s irreverent idea that artists’ scores belong to the ordinary social world of educational films and product packaging."

The aircraft safety card uses photographs in a highly abstract way—not least because too much realism might cause passengers to panic. In this example, a woman floats serenely in a swimming pool."

    extended_caption: "Allan Kaprow composed the program for *Private Parts* for a seminar on performance at the University of Wisconsin–Milwaukee in November 1976. He subsequently devised a shooting script for a video version of the activity and then produced this tape in 1977 at California State University, Long Beach. Peter Kirby shot and edited the video. An alumnus of Cal Arts, where Kaprow had been a dean and a professor from 1969 to 1974, Kirby managed the Artists Post Production Facility at the Long Beach Museum of Art in Long Beach, California. You can view the [*Private Parts*](/object-index/578/) videotape in the [Playback section of chapter 11](/11/#playback)."
