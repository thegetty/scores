This is one of Tudor’s earliest realizations of an indeterminate score. In fidelity to Feldman’s use of a metronome without any meter, Tudor uses no bar lines. Tudor’s notation is otherwise conventional. Octaves up or down are marked with local brackets and an “8” or “16.” Clusters are special attacks to be played with the palm or groups of fingers that include all notes notated with a vertical line linking two pitches. The clusters are fully chromatic (including all notes within the boundaries) unless marked by a natural sign, in which case only the white notes are to be played, or with a sharp sign, in which case only the black notes are to be played.
