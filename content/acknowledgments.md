The editors would like to acknowledge the contributions of the Getty Research Institute Publications staff—Michele Ciaccio, Janelle Gatchalian, and Gail Feigenbaum—as well as the herculean imaging efforts of Ted Walbye, Peter Dueker, Taylor Branham, and Sophie Chen-Iveson. The project was also supported by crucial research assistance from Kathryn Huether, Zach Rottman, and Anna Smith, along with guidance from Sarah Cooper, Megan Metcalf, Marcia Reed, Nancy Perloff, Emily Ruth Capper, and Tashi Wada. We are grateful for additional funding provided by the National Endowment for the Humanities–Mellon Fellowship in Digital Publication, the National Endowment for the Humanities Summer Stipend, the McKnight Foundation, the College of Liberal Arts at the University of Minnesota, and the Kathrine G. McGovern College of the Arts and Division of Research at the University of Houston. Above all, we express our profound gratitude to the artists and contributors for generously sharing their archives and expertise, and for the patience and faith that they and our families invested in this project over its extended development.
