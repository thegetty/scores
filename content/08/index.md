  blurb: "Throughout the 1960s, postmodern dance pioneer Yvonne Rainer experimented with diverse scoring techniques including movement maps, lists, charts, and “people plans” to capture indeterminate yet rule-based choreography stripped of artifice, expression, and narrative. A series of diagrammatic floor plans sketch out *We Shall Run* (1963), in which a cluster of “runners” in everyday clothes jog about in unpredictable groupings and patterns. Rainer never believed that a score could faithfully capture the complex dimensions of choreographic space, time, force, and shape; rather, her improvised scores functioned conceptually, as a broad methodology that fueled further innovation."
