This manuscript of Feldman’s score was drafted on graph paper, in an echo of Joseph Schillinger’s method of graph notation developed in the 1930s and 40s. Feldman’s draft freely distributes seven oblong rectangular staves in a way that is askew from the traditional vertical alignment of musical staves. No ruler was used.
