  - tag: "black"
    description: "George Brecht frequently referenced specific colors in his scores, including the rainbow of spectral colors (or the visible spectrum). This gesture was meant to cue thinking about the physical properties of light waves within the visual field in ways analogous to experimental music’s rethinking of the audible in terms of sound waves. In other words, Brecht wanted the beholder to understand that our perception of both sound and light unfold durationally."

  - tag: "cards"
    description: "Brecht’s early works sometimes employed decks of instruction or playing cards as a way of randomly assigning cues and/or actions to an ensemble of performers."

  - tag: "center"
    description: "Brecht’s references to a “center” in these scores may have been inspired by conversations with the poet and potter M. C. Richards. Their correspondence, which references the concept, is included in the [Archive section of chapter 6](/06/#archive)."

  - tag: "chair"
    description: "The chair was a particularly important readymade object in Brecht’s oeuvre for its availability, ordinariness, and implicit use value. Chairs appeared not only in his event scores but also as the main element in a series of sculptural arrangements or “chair events” that Brecht conceived and made in the latter half of the 1960s, including *Chair with a History* (ca. 1966), which included a notebook the sitter was invited to write in while seated on the artist’s readymade chair."

  - tag: "colors"
    description: "George Brecht frequently referenced specific colors in his scores, including the rainbow of spectral colors (or the visible spectrum). This gesture was meant to cue thinking about the physical properties of light waves within the visual field in ways analogous to experimental music’s rethinking of the audible in terms of sound waves. In other words, Brecht wanted the beholder to understand that our perception of both sound and light unfold durationally."

  - tag: "dedications"
    description: "Dedicating pieces to one’s peers and mentors was commonplace in the performance culture of Brecht’s milieu. *Water Yam* includes scores dedicated to John Cage, Ray Johnson, La Monte Young, Joseph Cornell, Robert Filliou, and Rrose Selavy, the female alter ego of Marcel Duchamp."

  - tag: "exercise"
    description: "Brecht’s event scores exploit slippages and elasticities of thought as language is correlated to one’s perceptual encounter with the world and its objects. This series of “exercises” in particular asks the reader to think about the relative flexibility of the notions of limit, center, object, and other, and reflects the artist’s interest in the Zen belief in the fundamental interconnectedness of all things. Brecht once said of *Exercise*, “I don’t think it would be correct to say that there are no objects or that Fluxus wanted to destroy them. The *Exercise* only shows how one can change one’s attitude to the concept of the object” (Gislind Nabakowski, “An Interview with George Brecht” (1974), in Henry Martin, *An Introduction to George Brecht’s Book of the Tumbler on Fire* [Milan: Multhipla, 1978], 95)."

  - tag: "Fluxus"
    description: "These three scores, probably written expressly for inclusion in *Water Yam*, are distinguished from all others included in the collection on multiple accounts. They employ white print on a black background, are the only cards to include mention of Fluxus (as part of Brecht’s address), and propose a subscription model in which individuals would write directly to Brecht in order to activate the work. Notably as well, the language used refers to the “realization” of the work or its being “arranged.” While conceptualizing *Water Yam*, Brecht wrote to Maciunas, “I would like to include in the ‘complete works’ box, a coupon, or coupons, which the subscriber could return to me, and for which I would send him an actual object or event. These coupons could be in de luxe copies of the box (this makes them ‘special’, which I don’t too much care for), or the coupon could be returned to me with some additional fee, for which I would send the work. What are your thoughts on this?” (Letter from George Brecht to George Maciunas, ca. January 1963, George Maciunas Correspondence, Hanns Sohm Archive, Staatsgalerie Stuttgart, Stuttgart, Germany)."

  - tag: "from object"
    description: "As with the first so-named event, *Motor Vehicle Sundown (Event)* (1960), inspired by a compelling situation Brecht noticed in his everyday life, the artist composed many event scores to capture phenomena he had already experienced. These scores were all composed “from objects”—that is, after objects or situations that Brecht noticed, found, or arranged. As he explained, “Once in a while I would make an object first and then make a card later. . . . I don’t feel very much one way or the other since every object is an event anyway and every event has [an] object-like quality” (Michael Nyman, “An Interview with George Brecht” [1976], in Henry Martin, *An Introduction to George Brecht’s Book of the Tumbler on Fire*, [Milan: Multhipla, 1978], 106)."

  - tag: "liquid"
    description: "Water and other kinds of liquid make frequent appearance in Brecht's collection of scores, a publication itself named *Water Yam*. As a versatile, shape-shifting material that nevertheless behaves according to certain physical laws, water and liquid are emblematic of the capacious yet succinct nature of the scores’ language and possibilities for realization."

  - tag: "musical instrument"
    description: "While musical instruments feature frequently in Brecht's scores, recalling both his father's career as a professional flautist and the indebtedness of the post-Cagean milieu to musical traditions, the scores almost never indicate to play the instruments in conventional fashion. Brecht's unusual deployment of such objects is meant to disrupt and reset our expectations and perceptions of them, opening our eyes and ears to nonmusical sights and sounds."

  - tag: "parentheses"
    description: "George Brecht’s use of punctuation in his event scores was as carefully considered as his choice of words. Regarding the parentheses that appear enigmatically throughout, Brecht wrote: “Words in parentheses refer to events in one’s experience. (Egg), for example, refers to the actual occurrence of egg in some form in one’s experience” (George Brecht, Notebook no. 9, December 1962–May 1963, Gilbert and Lila Silverman Fluxus Collection Archives, Museum of Modern Art, New York)."

  - tag: "red"

This gesture was meant to cue thinking about the physical properties of light waves within the visual field in ways analogous to experimental music’s rethinking of the audible in terms of sound waves. In other words, Brecht wanted the beholder to understand that our perception of both sound and light unfold durationally."

  - tag: "suitcase"
    description: "These three scores, each titled *Suitcase*, show a progression toward an increasingly distilled event concept. Beholders already familiar with Brecht's practice would know best how to read the most minimal of the instructions, simply “suitcase.” A series of three *Table* scores attempts something similar."

    annotation: "Among Brecht’s most well-known compositions, *Drip Music (Drip Event)* (1959–1962) bears many characteristics that typify the artist’s event scores, and the way it is dated suggests Brecht honed the text gradually and carefully over the course of his most intensive years of score-writing. In 1960, Brecht began to call his works “events” as opposed to “music,” and this score retains both titles. Its first line immediately opens the possibility of the work’s performance to a multiplicity of realizations, by either a solo performer or group, and even by nonhuman actors. (All possibilities would be experimented with by Fluxus artists, as [the Archive section of chapter 6](/06/#archive) shows.) Notably, the language avoids an imperative tone as well as outwardly naming the agent of the action. Instead, it describes in a rather passive way the existence of the phenomenon of water dripping, leaving the words *source* and *vessel* quite open to interpretation. The even more ambiguous “second version” included in the score’s text might be written for more advanced readers familiar with Brecht’s work, such as the virtuoso listener for whom, as the artist described in his 1959 notebook, “all sound may be music” (George Brecht, notebook page, ca. late July 1959, repr. in *George Brecht—Notebooks*, ed. Dieter Daniels and Hermann Braun, vol. 3 [Cologne: Walther König, 1991], 123). At this time Brecht also wrote the similar yet slightly more elaborate score, *Comb Music (Comb Event)* (1959–1962)."

  - title: "Motor Vehicle Sundown (Event)"
    fullText: "(TO JOHN CAGE) SPRING/SUMMER 1960 G. BRECHT Any number of motor vehicles are arranged outdoors. There are at least as many sets, of instruction cards as vehicles. All instruction card sets are shuffled collectively, and 22 cards are distributed to the single performer per vehicle. At sundown (relatively dark, open area incident Iight 2 footcandles or less) the performers leave a central location, simultaneously counting out (at an agreed-upon rate) a prearranged duration 1 1/2 times the maximum required for any performer to reach, and seat himself in, his vehicle. At the end of this count each performer starts the engine of his vehicle and subsequently acts according to the directions on his instruction cards, read consecutively as dealt. (An equivalent pause is to be substituted for an instruction referring to non-available equipment.) Having acted on all instructions, each performer turns off the engine of his vehicle and remains seated untiI alI vehicles have ceased running. A single value from each parenthetical series of values is to be chosen, by chance, for each card. Parenthetic numerals indicate duration in counts (at an agreed-upon rate). Special lights (8) means truck-body, safety, signal, warning lights, signs, displays, etc. Special equipment (22) means carousels, ladders, fire-hoses with truck-contained pumps and water supply, etc. INSTRUCTION CARDS (44 per set): 1. Head lights (high beam, low beam) on (1–5), off. 2. Parking lights on (1–11), off. 3. Foot-brake lights on (1–3), off. 4. (Right, left) directional signals on (1–7), off. 5.

    annotation: "*Motor Vehicle Sundown (Event)*, among Brecht’s earliest and most elaborate scores, was the first to include the word “event” in its title. Brecht has recounted the origins of this important piece: “In the Spring of 1960, standing in the woods in East Brunswick, New Jersey, where I lived at the time, waiting for my wife to come from the house, standing behind my English Ford station wagon, the motor running and the left-turn signal blinking, it occurred to me that a wholly ‘event’ piece could be drawn from the situation. Three months later the first piece explicitly titled an ‘event’ was finished, the “Motor Vehicle Sundown (Event)” (George Brecht, “The Origin of Events” [1970], in *Happening & Fluxus*, ed. Hanns Sohm [Cologne: Koelnischer Kunstverein, 1970], n.p.). It was premiered on 26 May 1962, in Ann Arbor, Michigan, by the ONCE Group (including Robert Ashley and Gordon Mumma) in a simultaneous performance alongside Dick Higgins’s *Constellation No. 7* and La Monte Young’s *Composition 1961 #21*."

    annotation: "In response to a letter from George Maciunas in which he describes Brecht’s event scores as “temporal readymades” (in the tradition of Marcel Duchamp’s object readymades), Brecht replied: “You are right in thinking that the event scores were not intended for performance in the traditional sense. I hadn’t thought of them as temporal readymades, but that description certainly fits. Using the first of the THREE YELLOW EVENTS as an example: at a certain point (imperceptibly beginning) it became evident that an event like Yellow Yellow Yellow could occur, and the score was written down. Some time later, possibly days or weeks, I was walking on every foggy evening and saw three dandelions growing from a single point. Later, on another evening, about midnight, I saw three yellow traffic lights blinking in unison. So—not only was the score unintended, but so were the realizations. I am not against injecting intention into the situation, and so realizing these works in a theater (which their sparseness certainly permits), but I think they may often be lost there unless surrounded with enough emptiness or formality” (Letter from George Brecht to George Maciunas, ca. January 1963, George Maciunas Correspondence, Hanns Sohm Archive, Staatsgalerie Stuttgart, Stuttgart, Germany)."

    annotation: "*Flute Solo* is an event score with uncharacteristically biographical origins, as Brecht’s father, George Ellis MacDiarmid, was a classically trained flautist who performed with the Metropolitan Opera Orchestra. About this piece Brecht once explained, “There is the story of the soprano who was bugging everybody with temper tantrums during rehearsal. At a certain point the orchestra crashed onto a major seventh and there was silence for the soprano and flute cadenza. Nothing happened. The soprano looked down into the orchestra pit and saw that my father had completely taken apart his flute, down to the last screw. (I used this idea in my 1962 *Flute Solo*)” (Michael Nyman, “An Interview with George Brecht” [1976], in Henry Martin, *An Introduction to George Brecht's Book of the Tumbler on Fire* [Milan: Multhipla, 1978], 121n19)."

    annotation: "George Brecht realized the score *Three Chair Events* for his contribution to the 1961 group exhibition *Environments, Situations, Spaces* at Martha Jackson Gallery. He placed three chairs in three different locations throughout the space along with a stack of copies of the score for visitors to take. A white chair appeared under a spotlight in the gallery, a black chair stood in the bathroom, and a yellow chair was placed outside. Brecht delighted in the black and yellow chairs’ marginal visibility as artworks, recounting that “the most beautiful event happened to the yellow chair that was outside on the side-walk in front of the gallery. When I arrived there was a very lovely woman wearing a large hat comfortably sitting in the chair and talking to friends. And do you know who it was? It was Claes Oldenburg’s mother” (Irmeline Lebeer, “Interview with George Brecht” [1973], in *An Introduction to George Brecht’s Book of the Tumbler on Fire*, ed.

While the scores are similar, this later version is more pared down in its language and as a result more open-ended in terms of how it may be realized."

    annotation: "Brecht’s realization of *Three Table and Chair Events* for the 1962 proto-Pop exhibition *Art 1963—A New Vocabulary*, organized by Anice Kandell and Billy Klüver in Philadelphia, was overlooked by many. A tableau of two white chairs and a table was set in three variations with props including a plate, silverware, glass, playing cards, and a newspaper that changed daily. Recounting the work’s reception in a letter to George Maciunas, Brecht wrote, “What happened was—many people used the furniture to put their coats on, to rest on, etc., and the piece was effectively lost in ordinary life! Nothing special! Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha—I am very happy about that. (Watching people sitting in the furniture was very like watching a ‘performance’, except that ‘ordinary’ people were acting naturally, without self-consciousness, and without the special training actors and dancers say is necessary to overcome that self-consciousness)” (Letter from George Brecht to George Maciunas, ca. January 1963, George Maciunas Correspondence, Hanns Sohm Archive, Staatsgalerie Stuttgart, Stuttgart, Germany). Eventually, however, Brecht tired of art audiences’ inability to detect his subtle arrangements long after the lessons of Duchamp should have been well absorbed. In the early 1970s, he complained that during a studio visit a pair of “specialists in looking at things” did not notice the broom and yellow dustpan that Brecht had carefully arranged in a corner (George Brecht, notebook no. 28, 8 December 1973–19 July 1975, Gilbert and Lila Silverman Fluxus Collection Archive, Museum of Modern Art, New York, p. 111)."

    fullText: "1. There are from 1 to 54 performers. Performers are seated side by side, except for the “chairman 11”, a performer who sits facing the others. They rehearse before the performance to develop common vocables of the four types described below. 2. The chairman holds a deck of ordinary playing cards (four complete suits plus Joker and Extra Joker). He tosses each card into the air so that it is free to fall face up or face down, then re-forms the deck and shuffles it, keeping each card in its face-up or face-down direction. 3. He then deals one card at a time to each performer in turn, including himself, until all cards have been dealt. 4. There is a second stack of “phoneme cards”, blank cards on each of which a single phoneme from one or more languages familiar to all performers has been written. These are shuffled and dealt, face up, one at a time, to each performer in turn, who keeps them in a stack separate from the playing cards. 5. At a nod from the chairman, each performer takes a playing card from the top of his sub-deck, performs a sound or not, according to the system of cues given below, and discards the card. Unless there is a signal from the chairman to repeat, or stop, the performance, each performer stops at the end of his sub-deck. 6. The Cue System: Suits: indicate the “vocal” organ primarily responsible for the sound production. Hearts: Lips Diamonds: Vocal cords and throat Clubs: Cheeks Spades: Tongue Sounds may be produced in any way, that is, with the breath, by slapping (of the cheeks), etc. Number Cards: indicate duration of sound, approximately in seconds. Face Cards (disregarding suit): indicate the speaking of a phoneme, with free duration, pronounciation, and dynamics, roughly as it might be heard in ordinary conversation. Specification and order of the phonemes is as indicated by the phoneme cards, read consecutively. Card Backs: indicate approximately five seconds of silence. Joker and Extra Joker: are cues only for the chairman, other performers ignoring them. Joker: Chairman crosses his arms at the end of his deck, signaling one repeat, and each performer, having reached the end of his own deck, runs through his cards once more, in the order in which they now occur (last card first). Then each performer stops, including the chairman (who ignores the joker during the repeat). Extra Joker: Chairman raises his arms, signaling an immediate stop to the performance.

At a sign from the dealer, each performer starts his stopwatch, and, interpreting the rank of the first card in each pair as the number of sounds to be made, and the rank of the second card in each pair as the number of consecutive five-second intervals within which that number of sounds is to be freely arranged, acts with an object corresponding to the suit of the first card in each pair upon an object corresponding to the suit of the second card in that pair.

Brecht may have been meditating on the type–token distinction in philosophy, which distinguishes between abstract concepts (types) and the material objects that instatiate them in our world (tokens). Indeed, the event score format in general—a type that generates diverse tokens—plays with this very distinction."

George Maciunas used some of Brecht's event scores in a similar fashion as part of the very first Fluxus exhibition, staged in the basement kitchen of the Galerie Parnass in Wuppertal, Germany, coincident with Nam June Paik's more well-known exhibition *Exposition of Music-Electronic Television*. Brecht's scores were arrayed throughout as curious labels for the room’s features."
