  full: |
    Artists working in and across the fields of visual art, music, poetry, theater, and dance at midcentury began to use experimental scores in ways that revolutionized artistic practice and opened up new forms of interdisciplinary collaboration. Their experimental practices—associated with the neo-avant-garde, neo-Dadaism, intermedia, Fluxus, and postmodernism—exploded in notoriety during the 1960s in locales from New York to Europe, East Asia, and Latin America, becoming foundational to global trends in contemporary art and performance. *The Scores Project* is a unique digital publication that provides a comprehensive view of this historical moment through a series of experimental scores and complete edition of the groundbreaking *An Anthology of Chance Operations* (1963). The featured scores by John Cage, George Brecht, Sylvano Bussotti, Morton Feldman, Allan Kaprow, Alison Knowles, Jackson Mac Low, Benjamin Patterson, Yvonne Rainer, Mieko Shiomi, David Tudor, and La Monte Young include expert commentaries from an interdisciplinary team of scholars and are accompanied by a digitized archive of over 2,000 ephemera and audiovisual materials. Ambitious, provocative, and playful, *The Scores Project* fosters a renewed sense of wonder at this innovative and historically complex moment in the history of art.

    Each chapter includes a Score, Commentary, Playback, and Archive section. The Score section showcases high-resolution images of the featured notation. The Commentary section includes a scholarly essay explaining the score’s original context and describes its key elements. The Playback section contains recordings of the score’s performance in audio, video, and animated formats, including both historical realizations and contemporary interpretations. The Archive section is a curated trove of hundreds of relevant primary materials, including letters, newspaper clippings, sketches, photographs, printed ephemera, and more. Featured images invite readers to dive directly into some of the most fascinating moments of these digitized materials. Finally, the [Object Index](/object-index/) allows users to browse and sort items from across all chapters, facilitating new discovery.
  online_edition: The free online edition of this open-access publication is available at [getty.edu/publications/scores/](https://www.getty.edu/publications/scores/) and includes video, audio, and zoomable illustrations. Free PDF and EPUB downloads of the book are also available.
