  blurb: "Fluxus affiliate Alison Knowles devised *Identical Lunch* as a combination of instructions and documentations of a simple lunch that she habitually ordered from a local diner near her studio in Manhattan. *Identical Lunch* is iterative and communal, existing across a number of formats and media—from the list of ingredients spoken and written to the food items ordered and the many social interactions instigated throughout. Though many experimental notations were crafted prior to performance, *Identical Lunch* emerged retrospectively, designating as “art” an ordinary event that Knowles and her friends performed repeatedly from the late 1960s onward."
