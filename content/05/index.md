  blurb: "*An Anthology of Chance Operations* is an uncertain textual object dense with history. The haphazard miscellany of scores, essays, and manifestos offers an early 1960s snapshot of competing cliques of New York–based practitioners who trained as visual artists, dancers, musicians, and poets. These individuals often worked to break down the separations between those disciplines with experimental notation as a common tool. The 1963 first edition was edited by La Monte Young, designed with striking typography by George Maciunas, and co-published by Young and Jackson Mac Low. Here, we present a complete digital edition of a rare, pre-publication, hand-bound proof from 1962 that names Jackson Mac Low and George Maciunas as publishers and includes materials ultimately excluded from the 1963 edition."
