  blurb: "Synthesizing the influence of Marcel Duchamp, Jackson Pollock, and John Cage, Fluxus artist George Brecht’s watershed event score *Drip Music (Drip Event)* (1959–62) helped catalyze a new wave of experimental notation that abandoned the look of staff notation in favor of the ambiguous poetics of the written word. A full digital edition of *Water Yam* invites users to manipulate and compare dozens of Brecht’s event scores: playful instructions for live performance or private meditation that cultivate the “virtuoso listener” for whom “all sound may be music.”"
