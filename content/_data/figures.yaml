Large rectangles are made up of smaller vertical rectangles such that the width of the page requires twice as many rectangles as the length of the page. Numbers on the outside of each rectangle create two concentric perimeters of numbers. Most of the interiors of the small rectangles contain at least one number, with most having multiple numbers, but with others having none at all. Generous white space between the two large shapes. "

    alt: "Thirty horizontal rectangular cream pages, each with black hand-drawn graphic notations made up of horizontal staff segments and circular musical notes. Notes are often connected by curving or straight lines to create shapes atop the staff. Graphics contain other musical notation symbols, numbers, and letters. Most pages contain at least three discreet graphics placed sparsely throughout the page. Most pages are less than 50 percent covered. Two pages are filled with four columns of handwritten text in English and one page filled with typewritten paragraphs in English. "

Pages are photographed in two-page spreads, with hole-punched ends connected at center to binder rings. Just under half of the pages are blank. Pages contain hand-drawn graphic notations in red, blue, or black ink and pencil. Most markings are either black circular musical notes connected by straight or curving line segments to create large shapes atop a staff or single red circular notes attached to red rectangular boxes filled with blue text by vertical lines. Any staff containing notation is marked with blue bar lines at either end. Generally, notations span the width of a staff when present. Five pages are sparsely populated with fewer than ten discrete notations. "

    alt: "Fifty-four loose leaf horizontal rectangular cream pages, each with two hole punches at leftmost edge and printed on front and back with six horizontal staves. Pages contain hand-drawn graphic notations in red, blue, or black ink and pencil. Most markings are either black circular musical notes connected by straight or curving line segments to create large shapes atop a staff or single red circular notes attached to red rectangular boxes filled with blue text by vertical lines. Any staff containing notation is marked with blue bar lines at either end. Each page contains a vertically oriented identifying string of letters and numbers at bottom left. Generally, notations span the width of a staff when present. Five pages are sparsely populated with fewer than ten discrete notations.  "

    alt: "Horizontal rectangular two-ring binder with black cover containing forty cream pages with two hole punches at leftmost edge. White sticker with black handwritten text reading “Performance Score: Solo for Piano # 1-80” at top right of front cover. Pages are photographed in two-page spreads, with hole-punched ends connected at center to binder rings. Pages contain graphic notation in black pen and pencil. Each page contains four vertical line segments roughly the height of a staff, two each at left and right edge,s to create two horizontal bands of space across the page. Notations on pages in line with bands are either (1) dots attached to rectangular boxes with text by a vertical line, (2) a horizontal staff segment with at minimum one clef and one musical note, or (3) Y-shaped markings annotated with letters. Most pages contain five or fewer groupings of notations. Many notations are annotated with either text or numbers. Rightmost edges of pages are annotated in pencil with numbers. Paginated 1–90 at bottom right of each page. Final two pages contain a handwritten list of materials."

Sometimes they speak in a direct, uninflected manner, and sometimes they speak in repetitive and percussive ways that emphasize dynamic qualities of vocal sound over the meaning of the words they are saying. Two original voices have been duplicated and layered electronically so that it sounds as if eight performers are speaking simultaneously, making it difficult to focus attention on any one voice for long. At times the voices are lowered in pitch. The final moments of the recording become quiet and feature only the original, single male and female voices, heard clearly."

    alt: "Color video recording taken inside a warehouse-like museum space. The first performance involves ten performers, including Simone Forti, grouped together in the middle of a large circle of spectators who are sitting on folding stools. The performers, who are barefoot and wearing comfortable street clothes, form a tight circle with their bodies, crouching down and holding their arms around one another’s shoulders. One performer at a time slowly and carefully climbs up and over the cluster of bodies. At one point Forti can be heard saying, “Take your time, take your time”; otherwise the event is largely silent. It concludes when the performers stand upright and break apart. The second performance, which takes place at one end of the space, involves four of the performers who now wear tennis shoes. They interact with a large, ramp-like board mounted at a 45-degree angle and with five evenly spaced, knotted ropes attached to the top of the incline. The performers hang onto the ropes as they climb up, down, and across the board, focused on their individual actions. The performance is largely silent except for the sounds of shoes and ropes making contact with the board.   "

Shots of the performers at all angles are shown--diagonal, upside down, and upright. Footage of the performers is interspersed with close-up reactions from the audience that show laughter, surprise, and boredom. The structure of the video continues, documenting other performances, one of a man altering and then playing an upright bass with found objects, a man dipping his tie and then head in a bowl of dark ink and rubbing a line across a long paper scroll on the floor, and finally the entire group attacking a grand piano with objects including a tea kettle, shoe, hammer, and brick. The voiceover is a male newscaster describing the activities in German; audio native to the filmed events can also be heard throughout."

    alt: "Color video of performance in outdoor tent with performers in white shirts and black pants, each sat at U-shaped table and each with a blender, facing a female conductor (Knowles) at center and an audience behind. Woman first faces away from performers and addresses audience, then conducts performers who turn blenders filled with liquid on or off, pausing halfway through to inspect several blender lids. Knowles returns to her central spot and continues conducting. Finally, Knowles and performers pour the liquid into cups and serve to the audience, some of whom give their opinion on the taste. Video flips between one hand-held camera that follows Knowles and captures close-ups of blenders and hands, and one stable camera behind the audience and facing the table of performers that captures entire scene. "

    alt: "Color film opening with male voiceover and blank white screen followed by title card “7 Kinds of Sympathy” in white on blue background. Film cycles through 1) a male voiceover accompanied by blank white background, 2) a color video of one or two people, either together or separate, performing actions from the voiceover, and 3) a title card with “later...” in white on blue background. Shots are stable and either close-ups focusing on hands or faces or wide shots of chest-up/full-body figures. Close-ups often capture movement or speech. Figures or hands are typically at the center of the frame, with no other points of visual interest. Background of scenes is either solid orange or solid red. Both figures wear maroon plain clothes. Four by three aspect ratio."

    alt: "Color film opening with title card “Private Parts” in white on black background followed by a male voiceover accompanied by stable shots of empty public toilets and occupied home bathrooms. Video then cycles through title cards with white text on black background and hand-held color video of a group performing the actions from the previous title card. Video shows group of people sitting in conference room chatting. Pairs take turns exiting the room, walking down a hall, entering the bathroom together, and performing actions like washing hands in the toilet or sink, and speaking to each other. Film often cuts back to the conference room where the group discusses what the absent pair are doing in the restroom. Four by three aspect ratio."
