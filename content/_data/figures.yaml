    caption: "*Intersection No. 3* with a dedication for David Tudor"
    alt: "Horizontal 11-inch-wide graph paper with seven horizontal staves outlined in pencil, each three grid boxes tall. Within the staves, seemingly random boxes are outlined and filled with handwritten numbers from 1-11 in black ink. Some grid boxes are outlined horizontally to create rectangles. Top margin handwritten text reads: outlined box “= MM 176” at left, “Intersection #3 for Tudor” at center, and “M Feldman (unreadable word) 1953” at right."

    caption: "David Tudor’s Realization of Feldman’s *Intersection No. 3*"
    alt: "Page printed with twelve staves containing pencil notation. Beginning at the top, the staves are grouped two together into a grand staff, with treble on top and bass on bottom, followed by an empty stave, and repeated four times for a total of four grand staves. Clusters of notes and other musical notations fill staves at irregular intervals, however page is balanced with a roughly equal disruption of notations throughout."

    alt: "Horizontal cream paper with orange printed grid. Three black horizontal marks evenly divide top third of page into three sections with a larger fourth section on bottom. Each section sparsely populated with squares and rectangles make from outlining one or more of the printed grid boxes. Key at bottom left reads: diamond shape “Lowest Harmonic,” “P Lowest pizz (played pizz),” “A Lowest Open sound (Played Arco)” and finally, identifies that one outlined pen square “= one beat.” Lines from top to bottom correspond to O, P, and A key."
